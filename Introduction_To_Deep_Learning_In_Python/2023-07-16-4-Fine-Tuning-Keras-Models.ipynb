    "## Understanding model optimization\n",
    "  \n",
    "At this point, you have a good understanding of how neural networks work, and how to build them in Keras. But you probably don't yet have a great intuition for how to choose things like model architecture and model optimization arguments. You'll learn that in this last chapter.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Why optimization is hard**\n",
    "  \n",
    "In practice, optimization is a hard problem. The optimal value for any one weight depends on the values of the other weights, and we are optimizing many weights at once. Even if the slope tells us which weights to increase, and which to decrease, our updates may not improve our model meaningfully. A small learning rate might cause us to make such small updates to the model's weights that our model doesn't improve materially. A very large learning rate might take us too far in the direction that seemed good. A smart optimizer like Adam helps, but optimization problems can still occur. \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Why is optimization hard?**  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- Simultaneously optimizing 1000s of parameters with complex relationships\n",
    "- Updates may not improve model meaningfully\n",
    "- Updates too small (if learning rate is low) or too large (if learning rate is high)\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Stochastic gradient descent**\n",
    "  \n",
    "The easiest way to see the effect of different learning rates is to use the simplest optimizer, Stochastic Gradient Descent, sometimes abbreviated to SGD. This optimizer uses a fixed learning rate. Learning rates around 0.01 are common. But you can specify the learning rate you need with `learning_rate=` argument as shown here. We have a function that creates a new model here. We create models in a for loop, and each time around we compile the model using SGD with a different `learning_rate`. We pass in the `optimizer=` with the same argument where we previously passed the string for `\"adam\"`. In an exercise, you will compare the results of training models trained with low, medium and high learning rates.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**The dying neuron problem**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Even if your `learning_rate=` is well tuned, you can run into the so-called \"dying-neuron\" problem. This problem occurs when a neuron takes a value less than 0 for all rows of your data. Recall that, with the ReLU activation function, any node with a negative input value produces an output of 0, and it also has a slope of 0 as you see in this graph. Because the slope is 0, the slope of any weights flowing into that node are also 0. So those weights don't get updated. In other words, once the node starts always getting negative inputs, it may continue only getting negative inputs. It's contributing nothing to the model at this point, and hence the claim that the node or neuron is \"dead.\"At first, this might suggest using an activation function whose slope is never exactly zero. However, those types of functions were used for many years.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Vanishing gradients**\n",
    "  \n",
    "For example, in an earlier video we used an s-shaped function called tanh. However, values that were outside the middle of the S were relatively flat, or had small slopes. \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Vanishing gradients**\n",
    "  \n",
    "A small but non-zero slope might work in a network with only a few hidden layers. But in a deep network, one with many layers, the repeated multiplication of small slopes causes the slopes to get close to 0, which meant updates in backprop were close to 0. This is called the *vanishing gradient* problem. This in turn might suggest using an activation function that isn't even close to flat anywhere. There is research in this area, including variations on ReLU. Those aren't widely used though. For now, it's a phenomenon worth keeping in mind if you are ever pondering why your model isn't training better. If it happens, changing the activation function may be the solution.\n",

This is a classification problem, and we'd like to see measures of accuracy. So, we include `metrics='accuracy'` in the `model.compile()` step. In the `.fit()` step, we specify what fraction of the data is used for validation. In this case, we'll use 30%.

We then create an \"early stopping monitor\" before fitting the model. That monitor takes an argument called `patience=`, which is how many epochs the model can go without improving before we stop training. 2 or 3 are reasonable values for `patience=`. Sometimes you'll get a single epoch with no improvement, but the model will start improving again after that epoch. But if you see 3 epochs with no improvement, it's unlikely to turn around and start improving again. We pass `early_stopping_monitor` to the `.fit()` function under an argument called `callbacks=`. Notice that `callbacks=` takes a list. You may consider adding other `callbacks=` as you become very advanced. But early stopping is all you want for now. By default, `keras` trains for 10 `epochs=`. Now that we have smart logic for determining when to stop, we can set a high maximum number of `epochs=`. This happens with the `epochs=` argument, as you see here. Keras will go until this number of `epochs=`, unless the validation loss stops improving, in which case it will stop earlier. This is smarter training logic than relying on a fixed number of `epochs=` without looking at the validation scores.\n",

    "## Thinking about model capacity\n",
    "  \n",
    "At this point, you know how to run experiments, and compare different models performance. However, it takes some practice to get an intuition for what experiments or architectures to try. There is still a little more art to finding good deep learning architectures than there is for tuning other machine learning algorithms. But something called \"model capacity\" should be one of the key considerations you think about when deciding what models to try.\"Model capacity\" or \"network capacity\" is closely related to the terms overfitting and underfitting.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Overfitting**\n",
    "  \n",
    "You may recall overfitting and a graphic like this from a previous course. Overfitting is the ability of a model to fit oddities in your training data that are there purely due to happenstance, and that won't apply in a new dataset. When you are overfitting, your model will make accurate predictions on training data, but it will make inaccurate predictions on validation data and new datasets. \n",
    "  \n",
    "<img src='../_images/thinking-about-model-compacity-neural-net.png' alt='img' width='550'>\n",
    "  \n",
    "Underfitting is the opposite. That is when your model fails to find important predictive patterns in the training data. So it is accurate in neither the training data nor validation data. Because we want to do well on new datasets that weren't used for training the model, our validation score is the ultimate measure of a model's predictive quality. Let's get back to model capacity. Model capacity is a model's ability to capture predictive patterns in your data. So, the more capacity a model, the further to the right we will be on this graph. If you had a network, and you increased the number of nodes or neurons in a hidden layer, that would increase model capacity. And if you add layers, that increases capacity. Said another way, making larger layers or increasing the number of layers moves you further to the right of this graph. \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Workflow for optimizing model capacity**\n",
    "  \n",
    "So, with that in mind, here is a good workflow for you. Start with a simple network, and get the validation score. Then keep adding capacity as long as the score keeps improving. Once it stops improving, you can decrease capacity slightly, but you are probably near the ideal.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Workflow for optimizing model capacity**\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Start with a small network\n",
    "- Gradually increase capacity\n",
    "- Keep increasing capacity until validation score is no longer improving\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Sequential experiments**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Let's walk through that process once. Here, I've started a model that has one hidden layer and 100 units. That's a relatively simple, or low capacity, model. I get a mean squared error of 5.4. Since I started with a simple model, I now try increasing capacity. I could increase the number of layers or use more hidden nodes. I'll start by using more nodes in the one hidden layer. That improved the model, so I'll keep increasing capacity. This time I'll switch to using 2 hidden layers. Each layer has 250 nodes. That improved the error more. So, I try 3 layers, continuing to add capacity as long as it helps. This hurt the score. So, the model with 2 layers and 250 nodes is about perfect. I'll try another model that reduces capacity slightly from the last model I built. That is 3 hidden layers with 200 nodes each. That seems the best model yet. So I'll stick with that. Should you change capacity by adding layers or by adding nodes to an existing layer? There isn't a universal answer to that. You can experiment. But you should generally be thinking about whether you are trying to increase or decrease capacity, ideally honing in on the right capacity by looking at validation scores.\n",

    "This is the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits. This is a very popular dataset for getting started working with images. There is an image of each handwritten digit, and each image is composed of a 28 pixel by 28 pixel grid. The image is represented by showing how dark each pixel is. So, 0 would be as light as possible, and 255 is as dark as possible. I've flattened the 28 x 28 grid for you into a 784 x 1 array for each image. Each image shows a digit like 0, 1, 2, 3 4, all the way up to 9. Your model will predict which digit it is that was written. So you will create a deep learning model taking in those 784 features for each image as inputs, and predicting digits from among 10 possible values for the output.\n",
