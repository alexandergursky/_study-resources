    "  \n",
    "During learning, the weights used by the network change, and as they change, the network becomes more attuned to the features of the images that discriminate between classes. This means that the loss function we use for training becomes smaller and smaller. Looking at the change in the loss with learning can be helpful to see whether learning is progressing as expected, and whether the network has learned enough.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Learning curves: training**\n",
    "  \n",
    "As long as learning is progressing well, we might expect the loss function to keep going down. For example, here is a curve showing the categorical cross-entropy loss in a network that is learning to classify different types of clothing, measured on the training set. You can see that loss rapidly decreases in the first few epochs of training, after which learning slows down. This is a sign that learning is going rather well.\n",

    "  \n",
    "On the other hand, if we add the validation loss to this plot, we can see that learning is progressing to some level of loss and then flattens out. What is going on? This is a form of overfitting. Because neural networks have so many parameters that can be adjusted, the weights can be adjusted to accurately classify, but this performance does not generalize well outside of the training set. When validated against a separate set of data, loss cannot become better.\n",

    "**Learning curves: overfitting**\n",
    "  \n",
    "In fact, if we keep training for many epochs, the validation accuracy can start increasing back up again. This is a sign that we have passed the point at which the model weights are being adjusted in a useful way, and we are starting to over-fit to the specifics of the training data.\n",

    "  \n",
    "To generate these curves, we need a model like the ones that you have seen before. We capture the results of fitting our model into a 'training' variable, which has a dictionary that stores the learning curves. We can plot the loss in the training set. And also add a plot of the loss in the validation set.\n",

    "  \n",
    "How do we use the best parameters before the network starts over-fitting? By using the `keras.callbacks` module from Keras which contains functions that can be executed at the end of each training epoch. One of these `callbacks=` is a `ModelCheckpoint` object that can be used to store the weights of a network at the end of each epoch of learning. When it is initialized, a .hdf5 file is created. Here we call it `weights.hdf5`. The callback monitors the validation loss, and will only overwrite the weights whenever the validation loss shows improvement. That is, the validation loss decreases. This means that if the network overfits, the weights will be stored for the epoch at which the validation loss was the smallest, before it started rising back up. The checkpoint object is stored in a list and passed as input to the model fitting procedure. After all `epochs=` of fitting are done, this file contains the best weights.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**Loading stored parameters**\n",
    "  \n",
    "To use these weights, we'll need to initialize the model again with the same architecture, the same layers, with the same number of units in each. We can then use the model's `.load_weights()` method to bring the model weights back to their value when the model was at its best during training. We can then use the weights in all kinds of ways. For example, we can use the model weights to predict the classes of a separate test image data set, using the `.predict_classes()` method. Each entry in the result is the column corresponding to the clothing article in the one-hot encoded array.\n",

    "  \n",
    "How do we prevent over-fitting and make the best out of our training data? One of the strategies that has proven effective is regularization. Here we'll discuss two strategies for regularization of convolutional neural networks.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Dropout**\n",
    "  \n",
    "The first strategy is called \"dropout\". In each step of learning, we choose a random subset of the units in a layer and we ignore it. This group of units would be ignored both on the forward pass through the network, as well as in the back-propagation stage.\n",
    "  \n",
    "In each learning step:  \n",
    "- Select a subset of the units\n",
    "- Ignore it in the forward pass\n",
    "- And in the back-propagation of error\n",
    "  \n",
    "Here is an image that explains this idea, from the original paper by Nitish Srivastava and his colleagues that introduced this idea in 2014. On the left is a fully connected network, and on the right is this network with dropout applied to it during one step of training. This might sound strange, but this regularization strategy can work really well. This is because it allows us to train many different networks on different parts of the data. Each time, the network that is trained is randomly chosen from the full network. This way, if part of the network becomes too sensitive to some noise in the data, other parts will compensate for this, because they haven't seen the samples with this noise. It also helps prevent different units in the network from becoming overly correlated in their activity. One way to think about this is that if one unit learns to prefer horizontal orientations, another unit would be trained to prefer vertical ones.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**Dropout in Keras**\n",
    "  \n",
    "In Keras, dropout is implemented as a layer. When we construct the network, we add a Dropout layer after the layer for which we want units ignored. When using dropout we'll need to choose what proportion of the units in the layer to ignore in each learning step. For example, here I have chosen to drop 25% of the units in the first layer. The rest of the model that follows is unchanged. Compiling and training the model is also unchanged.\n",

    "Another form of regularization in convolutional neural networks is called Batch Normalization. As the name suggests, this operation takes the output of a particular layer, and rescales it so that it always has 0 mean and standard deviation of 1 in every batch of training. This idea was proposed in a paper by Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy in 2015. The algorithm solves the problem where different batches of input might produce wildly different distributions of outputs in any given layer in the network. Because the adjustments to the weights through back-propagation depends on the activation of the units in every step of learning, this means that the network may progress very slowly through training.\n",

This is because while dropout slows down learning, making it more incremental and careful, batch normalization tends to make learning go faster. Their effects together may in fact counter each other, and networks sometimes perform worse when both of these methods are used together than they would if neither were used. This has been called \"the disharmony of batch normalization and dropout\".\n",

    "One of the ways to interpret the weights of a neural network is to see how the kernels stored in these weights \"see\" the world. That is, what properties of an image are emphasized by this kernel. In this exercise, we will do that by convolving an image with the kernel and visualizing the result. Given images in the test_data variable, a function called `extract_kernel()` that extracts a kernel from the provided network, and the function called `convolution()` that we defined in the first chapter, extract the kernel, load the data from a file and visualize it with `matplotlib`.\n",

    "## Wrapping up\n",
    "  \n",
    "Congratulations! You have completed this course on image processing with convolutional neural networks.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**What did we learn?**\n",
    "  \n",
    "These algorithms are the best we currently have for many computational tasks. Here, you learned about image classification. Classification is a particularly useful task and one that convolutional neural networks excel at. You learned how to set up a training set, a validation set and a test set and how to use them in training a model for classification and how to evaluate it. You learned about the fundamental operations of these networks: convolutions. The development of convolutional layers for neural networks ushered in the current golden age of computation with neural networks, so understanding how they work is particularly valuable, even if you continue to learn about other kinds of neural networks. One of the things that is remarkable about CNNs is that they have a very large number of parameters. This is one of the reasons that large amounts of data are usually required to effectively and accurately train a neural network. We looked at a couple of approaches to reduce the number of parameters: one is to tweak your convolutions, and adapt them to your problem. For example, using strided convolutions. Another approach is to use pooling layers. We also looked at a couple of approaches to improve your network, using regularization. Finally, you learned about ways to understand your network and visualize both the progress of learning, as well as the final result of learning: the parameters of the trained network.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Model interpretation**\n",
    "  \n",
    "If you found this topic to be interesting, you might want to read this paper by Chris Olah and his colleagues that explores different aspects of visualization of neural network results. This is an exciting time to learn about CNNs, because the technology is rapidly evolving, and some of the most exciting developments are yet to come.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Road**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Where does the road lead to from here?\n",
    "  \n",
    "**What next?**\n",
    "  \n",
    "There is a wealth of methods and ideas for you to dive into. Here are a few things to learn about next. In this course, you learned about simple architectures where one layer always connects only to the next. But there are other architectures that provide a variety of computational benefits. For example, you might want to learn about residual networks.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Residual networks**\n",
    "  \n",
    "These include connections that skip over several layers, and they are called residual networks because the network will use this skipped connection to compute a difference between the input of a stack of layers and their output. Learning this difference, or residual, turns out to often be easier than learning the output. This means that these networks have been surprisingly effective at tasks such as classification.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<center><img src='../_images/summary-other-networks-to-consider.png' alt='img' width='500'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**What next?**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Another topic you might want to explore further is transfer learning: in this approach an already-trained network is adapted to a new task. You've already learned how to read in weights into a network that you've defined. Now imagine training it again on another classification task. Sounds weird, but it's a great strategy for cases where you don't have a lot of data. In addition to convolutional networks that perform classification, there are so-called fully convolutional networks that take an image as input and produce another image as output.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Fully convolutional networks**\n",
    "  \n",
    "For example, these networks can be used to find the part of an image that contains a particular kind of object, doing segmentation rather than classification.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<center><img src='../_images/summary-other-networks-to-consider1.png' alt='img' width='500'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Generative adversarial networks**\n",
    "  \n",
    "A particularly interesting kind of networks are a generative adversarial networks. These complex architectures can be used to train a network to create new images that didn't exist before.\n",
