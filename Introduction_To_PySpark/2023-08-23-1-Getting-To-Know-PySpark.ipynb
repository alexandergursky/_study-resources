PySpark is the Python package that makes the magic happen. You'll use this package to work with data about flights from Portland and Seattle. You'll learn to wrangle this data and build a whole machine learning pipeline to predict whether or not flights will be delayed. Get ready to put some Spark in your Python code and dive into the world of high-performance machine learning!\n",

    "### What is Spark, anyway?\n",
    "  \n",
    "Spark is a platform for cluster computing. Spark lets you spread data and computations over clusters with multiple nodes (think of each node as a separate computer). Splitting up your data makes it easier to work with very large datasets because each node only works with a small amount of data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "As each node works on its own subset of the total data, it also carries out a part of the total calculations required, so that both data processing and computation are performed in parallel over the nodes in the cluster. It is a fact that parallel computation can make certain types of programming tasks much faster.\n",
    "  \n",
    "However, with greater computing power comes greater complexity.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Deciding whether or not Spark is the best solution for your problem takes some experience, but you can consider questions like:\n",

    "  \n",
    "The first step in using Spark is connecting to a cluster.\n",
    "  \n",
    "In practice, the cluster will be hosted on a remote machine that's connected to all other nodes. There will be one computer, called the master that manages splitting up the data and the computations. The master is connected to the rest of the computers in the cluster, which are called worker. The master sends the workers data and calculations to run, and they send their results back to the master.\n",
    "  \n",

However, RDDs are hard to work with directly, so in this course you'll be using the Spark DataFrame abstraction built on top of RDDs.\n",

When using RDDs, it's up to the data scientist to figure out the right way to optimize the query, but the DataFrame implementation has much of this optimization built in!\n",
    "  \n",
    "To start working with Spark DataFrames, you first have to create a `SparkSession` object from your `SparkContext`. You can think of the `SparkContext` as your connection to the cluster and the `SparkSession` as your interface with that connection.\n",

    "  \n",
    "In the last exercise, you saw how to move data from Spark to `pandas`. However, maybe you want to go the other direction, and put a `pandas` DataFrame into a Spark cluster! The `SparkSession` class has a method for this as well.\n",

    "The output of this method is stored locally, not in the `SparkSession` catalog. This means that you can use all the Spark DataFrame methods on it, but you can't access the data in other contexts.\n",

    "For example, a SQL query (using the `.sql()` method) that references your DataFrame will throw an error. To access the data in this way, you have to save it as a temporary table.\n",
    "  \n",
    "You can do this using the `.createTempView()` Spark DataFrame method, which takes as its only argument the name of the temporary table you'd like to register. This method registers the DataFrame as a table in the catalog, but as this table is temporary, it can only be accessed from the specific `SparkSession` used to create the Spark DataFrame.\n",
    "  \n",
    "There is also the method `.createOrReplaceTempView()`. This safely creates a new temporary table if nothing was there before, or updates an existing table if one was already defined. You'll use this method to avoid running into problems with duplicate tables.\n",
