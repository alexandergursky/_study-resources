    "# Introducing Keras\n",
    "  \n",
    "Deep learning is here to stay! It's the go-to technique to solve complex problems that arise with unstructured data and an incredible tool for innovation. Keras is one of the frameworks that make it easier to start developing deep learning models, and it's versatile enough to build industry-ready models in no time. In this course, you will learn regression and save the earth by predicting asteroid trajectories, apply binary classification to distinguish between real and fake dollar bills, use multiclass classification to decide who threw which dart at a dart board, learn to use neural networks to reconstruct noisy images and much more. Additionally, you will learn how to better control your models during training and how to tune them to boost their performance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "In this first chapter, you will get introduced to neural networks, understand what kind of problems they can solve, and when to use them. You will also build several networks and save the earth by training a regression model that approximates the orbit of a meteor that is approaching us!"

    "## What is Keras?\n",
    "  \n",
    "Welcome to this course on deep learning! This course will add Keras as a powerful tool to your arsenal. Keras is a high level deep learning framework,\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Keras**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Keras is an open source deep learning library that enables fast experimentation with neural networks. It runs on top of other frameworks like Tensorflow, Theano or CNTK. And it was created by French AI researcher François Chollet.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Why use Keras?**\n",
    "  \n",
    "So, why use Keras instead of other low-level libraries like TensorFlow? Well, with Keras you can build industry-ready models in no time, with much less code than Theano, and a higher abstraction than that offered by TensorFlow. This allows for quickly and easily checking if a neural network will get your problems solved. In addition, you can build any architecture you can imagine, from simple networks to more complex ones like auto-encoders, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Keras models can also be deployed across a wide range of platforms like Android, iOS, web-apps, etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Keras + TensorFlow**\n",
    "  \n",
    "It's the best moment to be learning Keras. Keras is now fully integrated into TensorFlow 2.0, so you can use the best of both worlds as needed and in the same code pipeline. If as you dive into deep learning, you find yourself needing to use low-level features, for instance to have a finer control of how your network applies gradients, you could use TensorFlow and tweak whatever you need.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Feature Engineering**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Now that you know better what Keras is and why to use it, perhaps we should discuss when and why to use a neural network in the first place. Neural networks are good feature extractors, since they learn the best way to make sense of unstructured data. Previously, it was the domain expert that had to set rules based on experimentation and heuristics to extract the relevant features of data. Neural networks can learn the best features and their combination, they can perform feature engineering themselves. That's why they are so useful. But what is unstructured data?\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Unstructured data**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Unstructured data is data that is not easily put into a table. For instance, sound, Videos, images, etc. It's also the type of data where performing feature engineering can be more challenging, that's why leaving this task to neural networks is a good idea.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**So, when to use neural networks?**\n",
    "  \n",
    "If you are dealing with unstructured data, you don't need to interpret the results, and your problem can benefit from a known architecture, then you probably should use neural networks. For instance, when classifying images of cats and dogs: Images are unstructured data, we don't care as much about why the network knows it's a cat or a dog, and we can benefit from convolutional neural networks. So it's wise to use neural networks. You will learn more about the usefulness of convolutional neural networks later on in the course."

    "  \n",
    "**Parameters**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Each connection from one neuron to another has an associated weight, $w$. Each neuron, except the input layer which just holds the input value, also has an extra weight and we call this the bias weight, $b$. During feed-forward our input gets transformed by weight multiplications and additions at each layer, the output of each neuron can also get transformed by the application of what we call an activation function.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Gradient descent**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Learning in neural networks consists of tuning the weights or parameters to give the desired output. One way of achieving this is by using the famous gradient descent algorithm and applying weight updates incrementally via a process known as back-propagation. That was a lot of theory! The code in Keras is much simpler as we will see now.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**The sequential API**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Keras allows you to build models in two different ways; using either the Functional API or the Sequential API. We will focus on the Sequential API. This is a simple, yet very powerful way of building neural networks that will get you covered for most use cases. With the sequential API you're essentially building a model as a stack of layers. You can start with an input layer. Add a couple of hidden layers. And finally, end your model by adding an output layer. Let's go through a code example.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Defining a neural network**\n",
    "  \n",
    "To create a simple neural network we'd do the following: Import the `Sequential` model from `tensorflow.keras.models`. Import a `Dense` layer, also known as fully connected layer, from `tensorflow.keras.layers`. We can then create an instance of a `Sequential` model. In this next line of code we add two layers; a 2 neuron `Dense` fully connected layer, and an input layer consisting of 3 neurons. The input layer is defined with the `input_shape=` parameter and it matches the dimensions of our input data. We finally add another fully connected layer, this time with 1 neuron.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Adding activations**\n",
    "  \n",
    "In order to add an activation function to our layers we can make use of the `activation=` argument. For instance, this is how we'd add a ReLU activation to our hidden layer. Don't worry about the choice of activation functions, that will be covered later on in the course.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Summarize your model!**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Once we've created our model we can call the `model.summary()` method on it. This displays a table with 3 columns: The first with the layers name and type, the second with the shape of the outputs produced by each layer and the third containing the number of parameters, these are the weights, including the bias weight of each neuron in the layer. When the input layer is defined via the `input_shape=` parameter, as we did before, it is not shown as a layer in the summary but it's included in the layer where it was defined, in this case the `dense_3` layer.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Visualize parameters**\n",
    "  \n",
    "That's why we see that this layer has 8 parameters: 6 parameters or weights come from the connections of the 3 input neurons to the 2 neurons in this layer, the missing 2 parameters come from the bias weights, b0 and b1, 1 per each neuron in the hidden layer. These add up to 8 different parameters. Just what we had in our summary. "

    "Welcome back! We are going to learn just what you're missing to be able to save the Earth from a meteor strike. But first, let's see how to compile, train and predict with your models!\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Recap**\n",
    "  \n",
    "In the previous lesson we saw how easy it was to create a model with Keras. You instantiate your `Sequential` model, add a couple of layers and their activations, and that's it, you've built a simple model in no time.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Compiling**\n",
    "  \n",
    "A model needs to be compiled before training. We can compile our model by calling the `.compile()` method on it. The `.compile()` method receives an `optimizer=`, which we can see as the algorithm that will be used to update our neural network weights, and a `loss=` function, which is the function we want to minimize during training. In this case, we choose `adam` as our `optimizer=` and mean squared error (`mse`) as our `loss=` function. Optimizers and `loss=` functions will be covered later on in the course, so don't worry about it for now. Compiling our model produces no output. Our model is now ready to train!\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Training**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Creating a model is useless if we don't train it. We train our model by calling the `.fit()` method and passing the features in `X_train`, the labels in `y_train` and the number of `epochs=` to train for. During an epoch, our entire training data passes through the network and the respective weight updates take place using back-propagation. As our model is being trained, we will get some output showing its progress. We can see the model is improving since the mean squared error loss is decreasing at each epoch.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Predicting**\n",
    "  \n",
    "To obtain predictions from our trained model we just need to call `.predict()` on the new set of data. We can store the predictions in a variable for later use. The predictions are just numbers in a `numpy` array, we will interpret these depending on our dataset and problem at hand.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Evaluating**\n",
    "  \n",
    "To quickly evaluate how well our model performs on unseen data we can use the model's `.evaluate()` method. This performs feed-forward with all samples in our test dataset (`X_test`). Feed-forward consists in computing a model's outputs from a given set of inputs. It then computes the error comparing the results to the true values stored in `y_test`. In this particular example, the model we trained for 5 `epochs=` before, has a mean squared error of 0.25.\n",

    "Your model fits perfectly to the scientists trajectory for time values between -10 to +10, the region where the meteor crosses the impact region, so we won't be hit! However, it starts to diverge when predicting for new values we haven't trained for. This shows neural networks learn according to the data they are fed with. Data quality and diversity are very important. You've barely scratched the surface of what neural networks can do. Are you prepared for the next chapter?"
