    "## Introduction to Text Encoding\n",
    "  \n",
    "So far in this course you have dealt with data that, while sometimes messy, has been generally columnar in nature. When you are faced with text data this is often not going to be the case.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Standardizing your text**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Data that is not in a predefined form is called unstructured data, and free text data is a good example of this. Before you can leverage text data in a machine learning model you must first transform it into a series of columns of numbers or vectors. There are many different approaches to doing this and in this chapter we will go through the most common approaches. In this chapter, you will be working with the United States inaugural address dataset, which contains the text for each President's inaugural speech. With George Washington's shown here. It is clear that free text like this is not in tabular form.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**Dataset**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Before any text analytics can be performed, you must ensure that the text data is in a format that can be used. The speeches have been loaded as a pandas DataFrame called `speech_df`, with the body of the text in the 'text' column as can be seen by looking at the top five rows using the `.head()` method as shown.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<img src='../_images/text-encoding-free-text-example1.png' text='alt text' width='500'>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Removing unwanted characters**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Most bodies of text will have non letter characters such as punctuation, that will need to be removed before analysis. This can be achieved by using the replace() method along with the str accessor. We have used this in an earlier chapter, but instead of specifying the exact characters you wish to replace, this time you will use patterns called regular expressions. Now unless you go through the text of all speeches, it is difficult to determine which non-letter characters are present in the data. So the easiest way to deal with this to specify a pattern which replaces all non letter characters as shown here. The pattern lowercase a to lowercase z followed by uppercase A to uppercase Z inside square brackets basically indicates include all letter characters. Placing a caret before this pattern inside square brackets negates this, that is, says all non letter characters. So we use the `.replace()` method with this pattern to replace all non letter characters with a white-space as shown here.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**Standardize the case**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Once all unwanted characters have been removed you will want to standardize the remaining characters in your text so that they are all lower case. This will ensure that the same word with and without capitalization will not be counted as separate words. You can use the `.lower()` method to achieve this as shown here.\n",

    "  \n",
    "Later in this chapter you will work through the creation of features based on the content of different texts, but often there is value in the fundamental characteristics of a passage, such as its length. Using the `.len()` method, you can calculate the number of characters in each speech.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**Word counts**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Along with the pure character length of the speech, you may want to know how many words are contained in it. The most straight forward way to do this is to split the speech based an any white-spaces, and then count how many words there are after the split. First, you will need to split the text with with the `.split()` method as shown here and\n",

    "  \n",

    "It may have become apparent that creating a column for every word will result in far too many values for analyses. Thankfully, you can specify arguments when initializing your `CountVectorizer` to limit this. For example, you can specify the minimum number of texts that a word must be contained in using the argument `min_df`. If a float is given, the word must appear in at least this percent of documents. This threshold eliminates words that occur so rarely that they would not be useful when generalizing to new texts. Conversely, `max_df` limits words to only ones that occur below a certain percentage of the data. This can be useful to remove words that occur too frequently to be of any value.\n",

    "  \n",
    "While counts of occurrences of words can be a good first step towards encoding your text to build models, it has some limitations. The main issue is counts will be much higher for very common even when they occur across all texts, providing little value as a distinguishing feature.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Introducing TF-IDF**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Take for example the counts of the word \"the\" shown here, with plentiful occurrences in every row. To limit these common words from overpowering your model some form of normalization can be used. One of the most effective approaches to do this is called \"*Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency*\" or TF-IDF.\n",

    "  \n",
    "TF-IDF divides number of times a word occurs in the document by a measure of what proportion of the documents a word occurs in all documents. This has the effect of reducing the value of common words, while increasing the weight of words that do not occur in many documents.\n",

    "$\\Large \\text{TF-IDF} = \\frac{\\frac{{\\text{(count of word occurrences)}}}{{\\text{(total words in a document)}}}} {\\log{\\left( \\frac{{\\text{(number of documents word is in)}}}{{\\text{(total number of documents)}}} \\right)}}$\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Importing the vectorizer**\n",
    "  \n",
    "To use a TF-IDF vectorizer, the approach is very similar to how you applied a count vectorizer.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "`from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer`  \n",

    "  \n",
    "**Max features and stopwords**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Similar to when you were working with the `CountVectorizer` where you could limit the number of features created by specifying arguments when initializing `TfidfVectorizer`, you can specify the maximum number of features using `max_features=` which will only use the 100 most common words. We will also specify the vectorizer to omit a set of `stop_words=`, these are a predefined list of the most common english words such as \"and\" or \"the\". You can use scikit-learn's built in list, load your own, or use lists provided by other python libraries.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Fitting your text**\n",
    "  \n",

    "  \n",
    "**Inspecting your transforms**\n",
    "  \n",
    "After transforming your data you should always check how the different words are being valued, and see which words are receiving the highest scores through the process. This will help you understand if the features being generated make sense or not. One ad-hoc method is to isolate a single row of the transformed DataFrame (`tv_df` in this case), using the `.iloc[]` accessor, and then sorting the values in the row in descending order as shown here. These top ranked values make sense for the text of a presidential speech.\n",

    "  \n",
    "So how do you apply this transformation on the test set? As mentioned before, you should preprocess your test data using the transformations made on the train data only. To ensure that the same features are created you should use the same vectorizer that you fit on the training data. So first transform the test data using the `tv` vectorizer and then recreate the test dataset by combining the TF-IDF values, feature names, and other columns.\n",

    "So far you have looked at individual words on their own without any context or word order, this approach is called a bag-of-words model, as the words are treated as if they are being drawn from a bag with no concept of order or grammar. While analyzing the occurrences of individual words can be a valuable way to create features from a piece of text, you will notice that individual words can loose all their context/meaning when viewed independently.\n",

    "  \n",
    "Take for example the word 'happy' shown here. One would assume it was used in a positive context, but if in reality it was used in the phrase 'not happy' this assumption would be incorrect. Similarly if the phrase was extended to 'never not happy' the connotation changes again. One common method to retain at least some concept of word order in a text is to instead use multiple consecutive words like pairs (bi-gram) or three consecutive words (tri-grams). This maintains at least some ordering information while at the same time allowing for the creation of a reasonable set of features.\n",

This can be done by summing the values of your DataFrame of count values that you created using the `.sum()` method.\n",
