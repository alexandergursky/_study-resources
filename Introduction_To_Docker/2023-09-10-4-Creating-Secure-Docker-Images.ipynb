    "In this final chapter, you’ll focus on making your Dockerfiles configurable and secure. You'll learn how to make your Dockerfiles configurable using the ARG and ENV instructions. You’ll see why changing the user in your images makes them more secure and how to use the USER Dockerfile instruction to do so. To wrap things up, you’ll learn about some essential security best practices when creating Docker Images."

    "**Dockerfile instruction interaction**\n",

    "The `FROM`, `RUN`, and `COPY` instructions only affect the file system, not each other. If we copy a start.sh file from our local file system into an image, we can then use the `RUN` instruction to execute this file. The two instructions didn't change each other's behavior directly, but both used and changed the file system. However, some instructions can influence other instructions directly. The `WORKIDR` instruction changes the working directory instructions are executed in, and the `USER` instruction changes which user is executing the following instructions.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**WORKDIR - Changing the working directory**\n",
    "  \n",
    "When using a Dockerfile instruction where we have to specify a path, we can always use a full path. For example, a path that starts at the root of the file system, like in the first example on the slide. When working with long paths, this can quickly become hard to read. The alternative to using full paths is the `WORKDIR` instruction, which allows us to change the directory inside the image from which all subsequent instructions will be executed. For the `COPY` instruction, we change the current path on which relative paths will be based.\n",

    "  \n",
    "Like with the `COPY` instruction, other Dockerfile instructions are influenced when the working directory is changed with `WORKDIR`. This includes the `RUN` and `CMD` instructions. The effect on the `RUN` instruction is straightforward. The shell commands executed by the `RUN` instruction will be run in the directory set by `WORKDIR`. This allows us to make the `RUN` instructions more readable and removes any unclarity about where the files we are running are located.\n",

    "What you can do in a Linux operating system or OS depends on your permissions. Your permissions, in turn, are set by assigning you a user. For example, a data science user could be allowed to access the datasets folder while other users are not. There is a unique user called the root user, which has all permissions on the system. Best practice is to use the root user to create one or more new users and only give these users the permissions required for specific tasks. Then we should stop using the root user and use these better-scoped users instead.\n",

    "When writing Dockerfiles, we should follow this best practice and not run everything as root. The image we start our Dockerfile from will determine the user. For example, the ubuntu image uses the root user by default. Any `RUN` instructions we put in a Dockerfile starting from ubuntu will be run as root. This has the advantage that all folders are accessible, and we won't get errors about permissions when installing anything. However, it is unsafe as all instructions will run with full permissions. The `USER` Dockerfile instruction allow us to change the user in the image. Any following instructions will be run as the user set by the `USER` instruction. It can be used multiple times, and the latest instruction will determine the user executing the following instructions.\n",

    "## Variables in Dockerfiles\n",
    "  \n",
    "Using variables in our Dockerfiles allows us to make them less verbose, safer to change, and easier to update. Let's see how that's done.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Variables with the ARG instruction**\n",
    "  \n",
    "First, we will look at the `ARG` instruction. The `ARG` instruction allows us to set variables inside a Dockerfile and then use that variable throughout the Dockerfile. It is followed by a space then the name of the variable we want to create, an equal sign and the value of the variable. Later commands can then reference this variable using a dollar sign followed by the variable name. However, it can only be used in the Dockerfile, the variable won't be accessible after the image is built. In other words, if you define a variable with `ARG` in a Dockerfile, build an image from that Dockerfile, and then start a container from that image, that variable will not exist inside the container.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<center><img src='../_images/variables-in-dockerfiles.png' alt='img' width='740'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Use-cases for the ARG instruction**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Typical use cases for the `ARG` instruction are to define a version we need in multiple places throughout the Dockerfile. Like in the first example on the slide, we specify a version of Python called bionic compiled for Ubuntu. Defining a path to a project or user directory is also helpful as an `ARG`. This allows us to make any instructions using this path less verbose and makes it more apparent at a glance that all files are going to the same folder.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<center><img src='../_images/variables-in-dockerfiles1.png' alt='img' width='740'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Setting ARG variables at build time**\n",
    "  \n",
    "The `ARG` instruction can also be set in the `docker build` command, giving us even more flexibility. At the top of the slide, you see the same example Dockerfiles as on the previous slide. By using the `--build-arg` flag when running 'docker build', we can set another value for the project-folder variable, which overrides the original value during that build.\n",

    "<center><img src='../_images/variables-in-dockerfiles2.png' alt='img' width='740'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Variables with ENV**\n",
    "  \n",
    "The second way to define variables in Dockerfiles is by using the `ENV` instruction. The syntax is identical to the `ARG` instruction, but unlike the `ARG` instruction, variables set with `ENV` are still accessible after the image is built. While variables set with `ARG` are used to change the behavior of Dockerfiles during the build, variables set with `ENV` are used to change behavior at runtime.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**Use-cases for the ENV instruction**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Typical use cases are setting variables used by applications when they are starting, like database directories or users - or setting an application to production or development mode. Unlike `ARG` variables, it is not possible to override `ENV` variables at build time. However, it is possible to override `ENV` variables when starting a container from an image. This can be done using the `--env` parameter of the `docker run` command. For example, in the official postgres image, there are several `ENV` variables available to configure the container.\n",

    "**Secrets in variables are not secure**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Both `ENV` and `ARG` variables seem convenient for adding passwords or other secrets to a docker image at build or runtime. However, both are not secure to use for secrets. Anyone can look at variables defined in a Dockerfile after the image is built with the `docker history` command. This command shows all the steps that were done to build an image. If, instead, we pass variables at build or start time, they can be found in the bash history of the host or image. The bash history is a list of all shell commands executed by a user. Keep in mind that if we use secrets to create our image without using more advanced techniques to hide them, they will be shared with anybody we share the image with.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**Inherent Security**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Docker inherently provides more security over running applications locally because there is an extra layer of isolation between the application and our operating system. This makes it much safer to open an application or archive from an unknown source in a container in comparison to doing the same on your local machine. However, that doesn't mean it is 100% safe to do so. A malicious payload can escape the container's isolation and infect the host.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**Making secure images**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Attackers breaking out of a container to the host operating system is the main risk of using containers. Docker and other container providers spend extensive resources on making their containers as secure as possible. Additionally, there are several things we, the creators and users of images and containers, can do to make both more secure. The safety measures we'll be discussing next might seem like they won't do much if we're just sharing images with colleagues or using them to run workloads locally. However, a widespread use case for images is running them on remote machines and allowing external access. For example, to run a database or a pipeline in a production environment. It is in those scenarios that the following safety measures become critical.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Images from a trusted source**\n",
    "  \n",
    "The first step to creating a secure image is choosing the right image to start from. Anybody on the Internet can provide images for us to use or build on top of. However, using images from an untrusted source is a security risk. The official Docker Hub registry provides thousands of images and allows the filtering of Trusted Content in three different ways. All three Trusted Content filters will give us images we consider safe for the most use-cases.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**Keep software up-to-date**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Even images downloaded from the official Docker Hub Repository aren't always up-to-date. Applications release updates all the time, and even operating system updates aren't incorporated into images the minute of their release. In the slide, you can see the extremely popular Docker Official Images Ubuntu and Mariadb, which were updated two weeks and a month ago. While it could be the case no safety-related updates have been made to anything installed in these images since then, best practice is to update the software to its latest version in images ourselves.\n",

    "What's better than ensuring all software in our image is updated? Having less of it. There is no safer piece of software than one we haven't installed. When creating a secure image, ensure you only install the software you need for its current use case. This also means we will have to keep less software up to date.\n",

    "  \n",
    "All previous measures are of little use if we allow anybody who gets access to a container to install anything they want. The solution is not to leave the user in our images as root. Often it is needed to install and configure applications as root; after that, the user in our image should be changed to a user with fewer permissions. If, for example, we change the user before the `CMD` instruction that starts our pipeline, we ensure that any malicious code in the pipeline does not have root access in our container.\n",

    "  \n",
    "In chapter one, we saw that containers are portable computing environments containing everything needed to run a workflow or application. They provide security, portability, and reproducibility. Then we dove deeper into Docker specifically by learning about Docker Engine, which is everything we need to create, run and manage containers. Wrapping up the chapter, we saw why the lightweight nature of containers made them gain popularity over virtual machines. To understand why this comparison is valuable, we first had to learn about virtualization, which allows us to run software isolated from each other but on the same hardware.\n",

    "**Chapter 2: The Docker CLI**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Chapter two is where we finally got our hands dirty. We went from starting our first container to running containers in several different ways, looking at container logs, managing several containers, and cleaning everything up again. Once we knew how to work with containers, we could learn more about images, where to get them, how they are versioned, and how we can share them with others.\n",

    "After seeing how to manage images, it was time to build our own in chapter three. Creating Docker images is done using Dockerfiles and specific instructions made for exactly this goal. We saw all the essential instructions allowing us to specify an image to start from, run shell commands, copy files, and more! At the end of chapter three, we looked in more detail at Docker layers, giving us insight into how Docker creates images and how we can optimize our images and keep them small.\n",

There are several more less-used Dockerfile instructions like ENTRYPOINT and HEALTHCHECK, among others, which are still very useful in the right circumstances. Still, in the context of Docker Engine, there is even more to learn, like how to start an image from scratch instead of continuing from an existing image or multi-stage builds, allowing you to create Dockerfiles built on top of multiple other images at once. Other topics not touched upon in this course are networking and volumes, respectively, allowing you to connect containers to a network and access local or saved files in a new way. And last but not least, there are several tools, like Kubernetes and docker-compose, to orchestrate containers. docker-compose allows you to define how a few containers interact, for example, a python container running a pipeline together with a database image the pipeline can connect to. While Kubernetes allows us to start, stop and do anything else imaginable from code.\n",
