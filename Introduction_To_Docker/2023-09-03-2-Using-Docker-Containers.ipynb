You'll see how to debug issues by running commands inside a container or executing bash commands in a container interactively.

    "  \n",
    "**Prerequisite**\n",
    "  \n",
    "In the rest of the course, we'll be using the command line extensively, and some familiarity is needed, which is why we advise you to take the prerequisite course introduction to shell if you're not already familiar with most shell commands on this slide. We will be using commands like `nano` with only a brief introduction, together with several others, which you can find on the slide.\n",

    "**The Docker CLI**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Let's get started with the Docker command line interface or CLI. The CLI will send our instructions to the docker daemon, which is responsible for managing our containers and images. After receiving our command, the daemon will reply with the result, which we'll see in the terminal. The CLI command for Docker is simply `docker`. Before we can start a container, we have to choose which image to start it from. We need an image because images act as blueprints or recipes from which we can start containers. Images define what will be installed and available when the container is started. The container is then a running instance of the image, which we can interact with. For example, there exists an image called ubuntu that contains the full Ubuntu OS. Once we start a container from that image, we have a fully running Ubuntu OS that we can interact with using a shell.\n",

    "<center><img src='../_images/running-docker-containers1.png' alt='img' width='740'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Docker container output**\n",
    "  \n",
    "If we want to start a container from an image, we can use the docker run command, followed by the image-name. For example, to start the hello-world image, we would use Docker space run space hello dash world. By default, Docker starts a container and shows you the container's output while it's running. When we run a hello-world container, it prints an explanation of how the container works and then stops.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<center><img src='../_images/running-docker-containers2.png' alt='img' width='740'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Choosing Docker container output**\n",
    "  \n",
    "When an image is created, the creator can choose what will happen when a container is started from the image. For example, the creators of the hello-world image choose to print out text and then make the container stop itself. Another example is the Ubuntu image, which contains a full Ubuntu OS. When starting an Ubuntu container, it will start and then shut down immediately without printing any output. Its creators decided that for their image, it didn't make sense to do anything specific by default. The Ubuntu OS starts, and it stops again without any output.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**An interactive Docker container**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Instead, the Ubuntu image is intended to be used with the `-it` flag. Using `docker run -it` followed by an image-name, we can start a container and simultaneously get an interactive shell in this container. If we do this with the Ubuntu image, using `docker run -it Ubuntu`, we end up in a new shell inside the new container. The shell gives us access to a clean Ubuntu environment isolated from our host machine because it is running inside the container. Once we want to exit the container, we simply use the `exit` command, which returns us to the host machine and then stops the container.\n",

    "We saw a container that just prints text and one that makes more sense to use interactively. A third type of container processes data or can be interacted with in some way externally, for example, a container with a database like Postgres or a data processing script. These are run using `docker run -d`, for detached, followed by the image-name. This makes containers run in the background without printing their output to our shell.\n",

The next step is stopping containers we don't need anymore. This can be done with the `docker stop` command. To stop the desired container, we pass the container-id to the docker `stop` command.\n",

    "  \n",
    "Downloading an image from Docker Hub is called pulling an image. The command to pull an image is `docker pull`, followed by the name of the image you want to download. For example, you can download the hello-world, postgres, and ubuntu image from Docker Hub using `docker pull`. When pulling an image using just the image name, we will always get the latest version available of the image.\n",

To pull a specific version, we use `docker pull image-name` followed by a colon and then the image-version. A version can be a number, some text, or a combination of both. For example, if we want the 22.04 release of ubuntu, we can use `docker pull ubuntu:22.04` or `:jammy`.\n",

For this, we have the `docker images` command, which will give us a list of all available images and tags. It will also tell us when the image was created, the size of the image on disk, and the image-id, which is a unique id to identify the image.\n",

    "Docker only has a limited amount of space it can use on our disk. Previously we saw how to remove containers using `docker container rm`. Similarly, we can use `docker image rm` to clear space for more containers and images. A container is a running image; a side effect of this is that you can only delete an image once there are no more containers based on it. If we try to delete an image for which we still have a container on our system, we'll get the warning you can see at the bottom of the slide. This error message also includes the container's id based on the image we're trying to remove. We can use the `docker container rm` command to remove the container, after which we can remove the image.\n",
