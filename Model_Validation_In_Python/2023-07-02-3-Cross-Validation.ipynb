    "The typical modeling procedure looks something like this. We take a dataset, use, say, 80% for training, and the remaining 20% for testing. We learned how to do this a couple lessons ago using scikit-learn. Using the `train_test_split()` function, we split our data and run a random forest classifier on this single split for our model. Here we have output the MAE, and the error was 10.24.\n",

If we split the candy dataset into 60 candies for training and 25 candies for testing, and build the exact same machine learning model, we'll probably get slightly varying results. In this example alone, the second testing accuracy is over 12% worse. Using the first sample, you would report an error of 10.32. The second gives an error of 11.56.

Each time we run the model, a different 80% of the data will be used for training, and a different 20% will be used for validation. And we can do this in such a manner that all of the data will be used in only one of the validation sets. This ensures that every point is used for validation exactly one time. Although using each point in only one validation set is not required for cross-validation, it is often good practice to do so.

Next, we create the generator `kf`, which will split our data. It uses the `KFold()` function with five splits and no shuffling. To actually split our data, we call `kf.split()` on X.

    "We have seen that `KFold()` is a great way to create indices that we can use for cross-validation. If you just want to jump straight into cross-validation and don't want to mess with the indices, you can use scikit-learn's `.cross_val_score()` method. This method requires four parameters. First, we have the estimator or the specific model that you want to use. In this example, we have a `RandomForestClassifier()` with the default model settings. Next, we use `X` to specify the complete training dataset and `y` to specify the response values. Lastly, the parameter `cv=` allows us to specify the number of cross-validation splits (or folds). In this example, we have set the parameter `cv=` to 5, allowing us to perform 5-fold cross-validation. By default, `.cross_val_score()` will use a default scoring function for whichever model you have specified. For example, if you have a `RandomForestClassifer` as the estimator, the default scoring function is the mean overall accuracy. For most regression models, it will return the R-squared value.\n",

    "If you want to use a different scoring function, you can create a scorer by using the `.make_scorer()` method, and specifying the scoring metric that you want to use. Here we create a scorer for the `mean_absolute_error()` function by calling `.make_scorer()` on scikit-learn's method for calculating the mean absolute error. Finally, we set the scoring parameter equal to the newly created `mae_scorer` inside the function.\n",

We load the model, `.cross_val_score()`, and both the `.make_scorer()` and `mean_squared_error()` methods. Next, we specify the regression model we want to use, with the specific parameters, as well as create the scorer that should be used when running the regression model. Finally, we call `.cross_val_score()` on the estimator, `rfr`, the dataset `X`, the response values `y`, and set scoring equal to the scorer we generated. In this example, we set `cv=` to 5 to complete 5-fold cross-validation.\n",

    "Let's look at the results. Notice how varied the mean squared errors are. The lowest was almost 86, while the highest was well over 200. If we have chosen an 80/20 split on the data at random, we may have reported an error as low as 86, or an error as high as 223. When we use cross-validation, we usually report the mean of the errors. In this case, it was 150. This is a much more realistic estimate for the out-of-sample accuracy that we can expect to see on new data. Eighty-six was probably way too low of an error, while 223 was way too high. Finally, we can look at the standard deviation to see how varied the five results were. The smaller the standard deviation, the tighter your 5 means were. This indicates that the actual accuracy for new data will probably match the mean of the cross-validation score fairly well.\n",

This means that every single point will be used in a validation set, completely by itself. For the first model, we will use all of the data for training, except for the first point, which will be used for validation. In model 2, we leave only the second data point out, in model three, the third data point, and so on. We create $n$ models, for $n$-observations in the data. It might seem odd to use a single point as a complete validation set, but recall what you will do after leave-one-out-cross-validation is complete. You will present the average error of the $n$ model runs.\n",

This method is also used because it provides the best error estimate possible for a single new point. Consider that you just ran $n$-models, where each time you left out a single point. If you are given a single new point and need to estimate your error, leave-one-out-cross-validation is the right method to use. Unfortunately, this method is very computationally expensive. You should be careful using it if you have a lot of data, or if you are planning on testing a lot of different parameter sets. The best way to judge if this method is even possible is to run `KFold` cross-validation with a large $K$, maybe 25 or 50, and gauge how long it would take you to actually run Leave-one-out-cross-validation with the $n$-observations in your data.\n",

We can find the number of observations by looking at the shape of the `X` dataset. The result of running leave-one-out-cross-validation will be a list of errors that stand for the error of running a model and leaving a single point out. The list will have $n$ values, where $n$ is the number of observations. Finally, we print the mean and use this as our overall error metric.\n",
