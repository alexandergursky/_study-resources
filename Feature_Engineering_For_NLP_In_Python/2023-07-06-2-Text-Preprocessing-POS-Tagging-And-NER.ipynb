    "## Tokenization and Lemmatization\n",
    "  \n",
    "In NLP, we usually have to deal with texts from a variety of sources.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Text sources**\n",
    "  \n",
    "For instance, it can be a news article where the text is grammatically correct and proofread. It could be tweets containing shorthands and hashtags. It could also be comments on YouTube where people have a tendency to abuse capital letters and punctuations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Making text machine friendly**\n",
    "  \n",
    "It is important that we standardize these texts into a machine friendly format. We want our models to treat similar words as the same. Consider the words \"Dogs\" and \"dog\". Strictly speaking, they are different strings. However, they connotate the same thing. Similarly, \"reduction\", \"reducing\" and \"reduce\" should also be standardized to the same string regardless of their form and case usage. Other examples include \"don't\" and \"do not\", and \"won't\" and \"will not\". In the next couple of lessons, we will learn techniques to achieve this.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Text preprocessing techniques**\n",
    "  \n",
    "The text processing techniques you use are dependent on the application you're working on. We'll be covering the common ones, including converting words into lowercase, removing unnecessary whitespace, removing punctuation, removing commonly occurring words or stopwords, expanding contracted words like don't and removing special characters such as numbers and emojis.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Tokenization**\n",
    "  \n",
    "To do this, we must first understand tokenization. *Tokenization* is the process of splitting a string into its constituent tokens. These tokens may be sentences, words or punctuations and is specific to a particular language. In this course, we will primarily be focused with word and punctuation tokens. For instance, consider this sentence. \n",
    "  \n",
    "<img src='../_images/nlp-tokenization-and-lemmatization.png' alt='img' width='740'>\n",
    "  \n",
    "Tokenizing it into its constituent words and punctuations will yield the following list of tokens. Tokenization also involves expanding contracted words. Therefore, a word like \"don't\" gets decomposed into two tokens: \"do\" and \"n't\" as can be seen in this example.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<img src='../_images/nlp-tokenization-and-lemmatization1.png' alt='img' width='740'>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Tokenization using `spaCy`**\n",
    "  \n",
    "To perform tokenization in python, we will use the `spacy` library. We first import the `spacy` library. Next, we load a pre-trained English model `'en_core_web_sm'` using `spacy.load()`. This will return a Language object that has the know-how to perform tokenization. This is stored in the variable `nlp`. Let's now define a string we want to tokenize. We pass this string into `nlp` to generate a `spaCy` Doc object. We store this in a variable named `doc`. This `doc` object contains the required tokens (and many other things, as we will soon find out). We generate the list of tokens by using list comprehension as shown. This is essentially looping over `doc` and extracting the text of each token in each iteration. The result is as follows.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<img src='../_images/nlp-tokenization-and-lemmatization2.png' alt='img' width='740'>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Lemmatization**\n",
    "  \n",
    "*Lemmatization* is the process of converting a word into its lowercased base form or lemma. This is an extremely powerful process of standardization. For instance, the words \"reducing\", \"reduces\", \"reduced\" and \"reduction\", when lemmatized, are all converted into the base form \"reduce\". Similarly \"To-be\" verbs such as \"am\", \"are\" and \"is\" are converted into \"be\". Lemmatization also allows us to convert words with apostrophes into their full forms. Therefore, \"n't\" is converted to \"not\" and \"'ve\" is converted to \"have\".\n",
    "  \n",
    "<img src='../_images/nlp-tokenization-and-lemmatization3.png' alt='img' width='740'>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Lemmatization using `spaCy`**\n",
    "  \n",
    "When you pass the string into `nlp`, `spaCy` automatically performs lemmatization by default. Therefore, generating lemmas is identical to generating tokens except that we extract `token.lemma_` in each iteration inside the list comprehension instead of `token.text`. Also, observe how `spaCy` converted the \"Is\" into `-PRON-`. This is standard behavior where every pronoun is converted into the string '`-PRON-`'.\n",

    "Every python string has an `.isalpha()` method that returns `True` if all the characters of the string are alphabets. Therefore, the \"Dog\".`.isalpha()` will return `True` but \"3dogs\".`.isalpha()` will return false as it has a non-alphabetic character 3. Similarly, numbers, punctuations and emojis will all return false too. This is an extremely convenient method to remove all (lemmatized) tokens that are or contain numbers, punctuation and emojis.\n",

    "If `.isalpha()` as a silver bullet that cleans text meticulously seems too good to be true, it's because it is. Remember that `.isalpha()` has a tendency of returning false on words we would not want to remove. Examples include abbreviations such as USA and UK which have periods in them, and proper nouns with numbers in them such as word2vec and xto10x. For such nuanced cases, `.isalpha()` may not be sufficient. \n",

    "  \n",
    "In this lesson, we will cover part-of-speech tagging, which is one of the most popularly used feature engineering techniques in NLP.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Applications**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Part-of speech tagging or POS tagging has an immense number of applications in NLP. It is used in word-sense disambiguation to identify the sense of a word in a sentence. For instance, consider the sentences \"the bear is a majestic animal\" and \"please bear with me\". Both sentences use the word 'bear' but they mean different things. \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Part-of-Speech (POS)**  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- Helps in identifying distinction by identifying one bear as a noun and the other as a verb  \n",
    "- Word-sense disambiguation  \n",
    "- Example: \"The bear is a majestic animal\"  \n",
    "- Example: \"Please bear with me\"  \n",
    "  \n",
    "POS tagging helps in identifying this distinction by identifying one bear as a noun and the other as a verb. Consequentially, POS tagging is also used in sentiment analysis, question answering systems and linguistic approaches to detect fake news and opinion spam. For example, one paper discovered that fake news headlines, on average, tend to use lesser common nouns and more proper nouns than mainstream headlines. Generating the POS tags for these words proved extremely useful in detecting false or hyperpartisan news.\n",

    "- Fake news and opinion spam detection  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**POS tagging**\n",
    "  \n",
    "So what is POS tagging? It is the process of assigning every word (or token) in a piece of text, its corresponding part-of-speech. For instance, consider the sentence \"Jane is an amazing guitarist\". A typical POS tagger will label Jane as a proper noun, is as a verb, an as a determiner (or an article), amazing as an adjective and finally, guitarist as a noun.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\"Jane is an amazing guitarist\"  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Jane -> Proper noun\n",
    "is -> Verb\n",

    "  \n",
    "**POS tagging using `spaCy`**\n",
    "  \n",
    "POS Tagging is extremely easy to do using `spaCy`'s models and performing it is almost identical to generating tokens or lemmas. As usual, we import the `spacy` library and load the `'en_core_web_sm'` model as `nlp`. We will use the same sentence \"Jane is an amazing guitarist\" from before. We will then create a `Doc` object that will perform POS tagging, by default.\n",

    "import spacy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the en_core_web_sm pre-trained model\n",
    "nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize string\n",
    "string = \"Jane is an amazing guitarist\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Doc object instantiation\n",
    "doc = nlp(string)\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "**POS tagging using `spaCy`**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Using list comprehension, we generate a list of tuples `pos` where the first element of the tuple is the `token` and is generated using `token.text` and the second element is its POS tag, which is generated using `token.pos_`. Printing `pos` will give us the following output. Note how the tagger correctly identified all the parts-of-speech as we had discussed earlier. That said, remember that POS tagging is not an exact science. \n",
    "  \n",
    "*`spaCy` infers the POS tags of these words based on the predictions given by its pre-trained models. In other words, the accuracy of the POS tagging is dependent on the data that the model has been trained on and the data that it is being used on.*\n",

    "```python\n",
    "...\n",

    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "**POS annotations in `spaCy`**\n",
    "  \n",
    "`spaCy` is capable of identifying close to 20 parts-of-speech and as we saw in the previous slide, it uses specific annotations to denote a particular part of speech. For instance, `PROPN` referred to a proper noun and `DET` referred to a determinant. You can find the complete list of POS annotations used by `spaCy` in `spaCy's documentation.

    "The final technique we will learn as part of this chapter is named entity recognition.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Applications of Named Entity Recognition (NER)**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Named entity recognition or NER has a host of extremely useful applications. It is used to build efficient search algorithms and question answering systems. For instance, let us say you have a piece of text and you ask your system about the people that are being talked about in the text. NER would help the system in answering this question by identifying all the entities that refer to a person in the text. NER also found application with News Providers who use it to categorize their articles and Customer Service centers who use it to classify and record their complaints efficiently.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Applications of (NER)**\n",
    "- Efficient search algorithms\n",
    "- Question answering (~*ie. chat-bots*)\n",
    "- Document segmentation (~*classifying documents or records, ie. Customer Service complaints*)\n",
    "- News article classification\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Named entity recognition**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Let us now get down to the definitions. A named entity is anything that can be denoted with a proper name or a proper noun. Named entity recognition or NER, therefore, is the process of identifying such named entities in a piece of text and classifying them into predefined categories such as person, organization, country, etc. For example, consider the text \"John Doe is a software engineer working at Google. He lives in France.\" Performing NER on this text will tell us that there are three named entities: John Doe, who is a person, Google, which is an organization and France, which is a country (or geopolitical entity)\n",
    "  \n",
    "\"John Doe is a software engineer working at Google. He lives in France.\"  \n",
    "  \n",
    "John Doe -> Person  \n",
    "Google -> Orginization  \n",
    "France -> Country (geopolitical entity)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**NER using spaCy**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Like POS tagging, performing NER is extremely easy using spaCy's pre-trained models. Let's try to find the named entities in the same sentence we used earlier. As usual, we import the `spacy` library, load the required model and create a `Doc` object for the `string`. When we do this, `spaCy` automatically computes all the named entities and makes it available as the ents attribute of `doc`. Therefore, to access the named entity and its category, we use list comprehension to loop over `doc.ents` and create a tuple containing the entity `name`, which is accessed using `ent.text`, and entity category, which is accessed using `ent.label_`. Printing this list out will give the following output. We see that `spaCy` has correctly identified and classified all the named entities in this string.\n",
    "  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "import spacy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the en_core_web_sm pre-trained model\n",
    "nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize string\n",
    "string = \"John Doe is a software engineer working at Google. He lives in France.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Doc object instantiation\n",
    "doc = nlp(string)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generating named entities\n",
    "ne = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]\n",
    "print(ne)\n",
    "\n",
    "out[1] : [('John Doe', 'PERSON'), ('Google', 'ORG'), ('France', 'GPE')]\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "**NER annotations in `spaCy`**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Currently, spaCy's models are capable of identifying more than 15 different types of named entities. The complete list of categories and their annotations can be found in spaCy's documentatiion.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**A word of caution**\n",
    "  \n",
    "In this chapter, we have used spacy's models to accomplish several tasks. However, remember that spacy's models are not perfect and its performance depends on the data it was trained with and the data it is being used on. For instance, if we are trying extract named entities for texts from a heavily technical field, such as medicine, spacy's pretrained models may not perform such a great job. In such nuanced cases, it is better to train your models with your specialized data. Also, remember that spacy's models are language specific. This is understandable considering that each language has its own grammar and nuances. The `en_core_web_sm` model that we've been using is, as the name suggests, only suitable for English texts.\n",
