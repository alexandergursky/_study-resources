    "# Basic features and readability scores\n",
    "  \n",
    "In this course, you will learn techniques that will allow you to extract useful information from text and process them into a format suitable for applying ML models. More specifically, you will learn about POS tagging, named entity recognition, readability scores, the n-gram and tf-idf models, and how to implement them using `scikit-learn` and `spaCy`. You will also learn to compute how similar two documents are to each other. In the process, you will predict the sentiment of movie reviews and build movie and Ted Talk recommenders. Following the course, you will be able to engineer critical features out of any text and solve some of the most challenging problems in data science!\n",

    "  \n",
    "Welcome to Feature Engineering for NLP in Python! In this course, you will learn to extract useful features out of text and convert them into formats that are suitable for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Numerical data**\n",
    "  \n",
    "For any ML algorithm, data fed into it must be in tabular form and all the training features must be numerical. Consider the Iris dataset. Every training instance has exactly four numerical features. The ML algorithm uses these four features to train and predict if an instance belongs to class iris-virginica, iris-setosa or iris-versicolor.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**One-hot encoding**\n",
    "  \n",
    "ML algorithms can also work with categorical data provided they are converted into numerical form through one-hot encoding. Let's say you have a categorical feature 'sex' with two categories 'male' and 'female'. One-hot encoding will convert this feature into two features, 'sex_male' and 'sex_female' such that each male instance has a 'sex_male' value of 1 and 'sex_female' value of 0. For females, it is the vice versa.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**One-hot encoding with pandas**\n",
    "  \n",
    "To do this in code, we use pandas' `pd.get_dummies()` function. Let's import pandas using the alias pd. We can then pass our dataframe `df` into the `pd.get_dummies()` function and pass a list of features to be encoded as the `columns=` argument. Not mentioning columns will lead pandas to automatically encode all non-numerical features. Finally, we overwrite the original dataframe with the encoded version by assigning the dataframe returned by `pd.get_dummies()` back to `df`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv(<dataset>)\n",
    "df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['<desired-dataset-feature-to-one-hot-encode>'])\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Textual data**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Consider a movie reviews dataset, with a 'review' feature and a 'class' feature that contains 2 values, positive and negative. This data cannot be utilized by any machine learning or ML algorithm. The training feature 'review' isn't numerical. Neither is it categorical to perform one-hot encoding on.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Text pre-processing**\n",
    "  \n",
    "We need to perform two steps to make this dataset suitable for ML. The first is to standardize the text. This involves steps like converting words to lowercase and their base form. For instance, 'Reduction' gets lowercased to 'reduction' and then converted to its base form, `reduce`. We will cover these concepts in more detail in subsequent lessons.\n",

    "**POS tagging**\n",
    "  \n",
    "So far, we have seen how to extract features out of an entire body of text. Some NLP applications may require you to extract features for individual words. For instance, you may want to do *parts-of-speech* tagging to know the different parts-of-speech present in your text as shown. As an example, consider the sentence \"I have a dog\". POS tagging will label each word with its corresponding part-of-speech.\n",

The number of characters is the length of the string. Python gives us a built-in `len()` function which returns the length of the string passed into it. The output will be 13 here too. If our dataframe `df` has a textual feature (say `'review'`), we can compute the number of characters for each review and store it as a new feature `'num_chars'` by using the `pandas` dataframe `.apply()` method. This is done by creating `df['num_chars']` and assigning it to `df['review'].apply(len)`.\n",

    "In this lesson, we will look at a set of interesting features known as *readability tests*.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Overview of readability tests**\n",
    "  \n",
    "These tests are used to determine the readability of a particular passage. In other words, it indicates at what educational level a person needs to be in, in order to comprehend a particular piece of text. The scale usually ranges from primary school up to college graduate level and is in context of the American education system. Readability tests are done using a mathematical formula that utilizes the word, syllable and sentence count of the passage. They are routinely used by organizations to determine how easy their publications are to understand. They have also found applications in domains such as fake news and opinion spam detection.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Readability text examples**\n",
    "  \n",
    "There are a variety of readability tests in use. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Some of the common Readability test include**\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The Flesch reading ease *~Covered in this course*\n",
    "- The Gunning fog index *~Covered in this course*\n",
    "- The simple measure of gobbledygook (SMOG)\n",
    "- The Dale-Chall score \n",
    "  \n",
    "Note that these tests are used for texts in English. Tests for other languages also exist that that take into consideration, the nuances of that particular language. For the sake of brevity, we will cover only the\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Readability test examples**\n",
    "  \n",
    "first two scores in detail. However, once you understand them, you will be in a good position to understand and use the other scores too.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Flesch reading ease**\n",
    "  \n",
    "The Flesch Reading Ease is one of the oldest and most widely used readability tests. The score is based on two ideas: the first is that the greater the average sentence length, harder the text is to read. Consider these two sentences. The first is easier to follow than the second. \n",
    "  \n",
    "\"This is a short sentence.\"  \n",
    "\"This is a longer sentence with more words and it is harder to follow than the first sentence.\"  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The second is that the greater the average number of syllables in a word, the harder the text is to read. Therefore, \"I live in my home\" is considered easier to read than \"I reside in my domicile\" on account of its usage of lesser syllables per word. The higher the Flesch Reading Ease score, the greater is the readability. Therefore, a higher score indicates that the text is easier to understand.\n",

    "  \n",
    "This table shows how to interpret the Flesch Reading Ease scores. A score above 90 would imply that the text is comprehensible to a 5th grader whereas a score below 30 would imply the text can only be understood by college graduates.\n",

    "  \n",
    "The Gunning fog index was developed in 1954. Like Flesch, this score is also dependent on the average sentence length. However, it uses percentage of complex words in place of average syllables per word to compute its score. Here, complex words refer to all words that have three or more syllables. Unlike Flesch, the formula for Gunning fog index is such that the higher the score, the more difficult the passage is to understand.\n",

    "  \n",
    "We can conduct these readability tests in Python using the `Textatistic` library. We import the `Textatistic` class from `textatistic`. Next, we create a `Textatistic` object and pass in the passage or text we're evaluating. We then access the dictionary of readability scores from the `Textatistic` object using the '`scores`' attribute and store it in a variable named `readability_scores`. Finally, we access the various scores from the `readability_scores` dictionary using their corresponding keys as shown. In this example, the text that was passed is between the reading level of a college senior and that of a college graduate.\n",
