    "# The Issues with Fitting Then Transforming for NMF Recomendation Systems\n",
    "In scikit-learn, the fit() method is used to train a machine learning model on a given dataset, while the transform() method is used to transform the dataset based on the model that was trained using the fit() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the fit_transform() method is used to both train the model and transform the dataset in a single step.\n",
    "\n",
    "While fit() and transform() can be used separately, fit_transform() is specifically designed to optimize the training and transformation processes for certain models, and may perform optimizations that are not possible when using the two methods separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all models in scikit-learn support fit_transform(), and in some cases, using fit_transform() may not be appropriate. For example, when dealing with large datasets, it may be more efficient to use fit() to train the model and then apply transform() to multiple batches of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is important to read the documentation for each model and method to understand when to use each one appropriately, and avoid using them interchangeably."
