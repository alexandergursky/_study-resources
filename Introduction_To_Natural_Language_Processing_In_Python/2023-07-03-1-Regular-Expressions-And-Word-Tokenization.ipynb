    "  \n",
    "*Regular expressions are strings you can use that have a special syntax, which allows you to match patterns and find other strings.*  \n",
    "  \n",
    "A pattern is a series of letters or symbols which can map to an actual text or words or punctuation. You can use regular expressions to do things like find links in a webpage, parse email addresses and remove unwanted strings or characters. Regular expressions are often referred to as regex and can be used easily with python via the `re` library. Here we have a simple import of the library. We can match a substring by using the `re.match()` method which matches a pattern with a string. It takes the pattern as the first argument, the string as the second and returns a match object, here we see it matched exactly what we expected: abc. We can also use special patterns that regex understands, like the `\\w+` which will match a word. We can see here via the match object representation that it has matched the first word it found -- hi.\n",

    "  \n",
    "There are hundreds of characters and patterns you can learn and memorize with regular expressions, but to get started, I want to share a few common patterns. The first pattern `\\w` we already saw, it is used to match words. The `\\d` pattern allows us to match digits, which can be useful when you need to find them and separate them in a string. The `\\s` pattern matches spaces, the `.` is a wildcard character. The wildcard will match ANY letter or symbol. The `+` and `*` characters allow things to become greedy, grabbing repeats of single letters or whole patterns. For example to match a full word rather than one character, we need to add the `+` symbol after the `\\w`. Using these character classes as capital letters negates them so the `\\S` matches anything that is not a space. You can also create a group of characters you want by putting them inside square brackets `[ ]`, like our lowercase group.\n",

    "In the following exercises, you'll use the `re` module to perform some simple activities, like splitting on a pattern or finding all patterns in a string. In addition to `.split()` and `.findall()`, `.search()` and `.match()` are also quite popular. You saw a simple match at the beginning of this video, and search is similar but doesn't require you to match the pattern from the beginning of the string. The syntax for the regex library is always to pass the pattern first, and the string second. Depending on the method, it may return an iterator, a new string or a match object. Here we see the `re.split()` method will take a pattern for spaces and a string with some spaces and return a list object with the results of splitting on spaces. This can be used for tokenization, so you can preprocess text using regex while doing natural language processing.\n",

    "**What is tokenization?**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Tokenization is the process of transforming a string or document into smaller chunks, which we call tokens. This is usually one step in the process of preparing a text for natural language processing. There are many different theories and rules regarding tokenization, and you can create your own tokenization rules using regular expresssions, but normally tokenization will do things like break out words or sentences, often separate punctuation or you can even just tokenize parts of a string like separating all hashtags in a Tweet.\n",

    "  \n",
    "One library that is commonly used for simple tokenization is `nltk`, the natural language toolkit library. Here is a short example of using the `word_tokenize` method to break down a string into tokens. We can see from the result that words are separated and punctuation are individual tokens as well.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<img src='../_images/intro-to-tokenization1.png' alt='img' width='500'>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Why tokenize?**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Why bother with tokenization? Because it can help us with some simple text processing tasks like mapping part of speech, matching common words and perhaps removing unwanted tokens like common words or repeated words. Here, we have a good example. The sentence is: \"I don't like Sam's shoes.\" When we tokenize it we can clearly see the negation in the not and we can see possession with the 's. These indicators can help us determine meaning from simple text.\n",

    "**Other nltk tokenizers**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Beyond just tokenizing words, NLTK has plenty of other tokenizers you can use, including these ones you'll be working with in this chapter. The `sent_tokenize()` function will split a document into individual sentences. The `regexp_tokenize()` uses regular expressions to tokenize the string, giving you more granular control over the process. And the `tweettokenizer()` does neat things like recognize hashtags, mentions and when you have too many punctuation symbols following a sentence. How convenient!!!\n",

    "**More regex practice**\n",
    "  \n",
    "You'll be using more regex in this section as well, not only when you are tokenizing, but also figuring out how to parse tokens and text. Using the regex module's `re.match()` and `re.search()` are pretty essential tools for Python string processing. Learning when to use search versus match can be challenging, so let's take a look at how they are different. When we use search and match with the same pattern and string with the pattern is at the beginning of the string, we see we find identical matches. That is the case with matching and searching abcde with the pattern abc. When we use search for a pattern that appears later in the string we get a result, but we don't get the same result using match. This is because match will try and match a string from the beginning until it cannot match any longer. \n",
    "  \n",
    "Search will go through the ENTIRE string to look for match options. If you need to find a pattern that might not be at the beginning of the string, you should use search. If you want to be specific about the composition of the entire string, or at least the initial pattern, then you should use match.\n",

    "## Advanced tokenization with regex\n",
    "  \n",
    "In this video, we'll take a look at doing more advanced tokenization with regex.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Regex groups using or \"|\"**\n",
    "  \n",
    "One new regex pattern you will find useful for advanced tokenization is the ability to use the or method. In regex, OR is represented by the pipe character. To use the or, you can define a group using parenthesis. Groups can be either a pattern or a set of characters you want to match. You can also define explicit character classes using square brackets. We'll go a bit more into depth on groups and ranges soon. Let's take an example that we want to tokenize using regular expressions and we want to find all digits and words. We define our pattern using a group with the OR symbol and make them greedy so they catch the full word or digits. Then, we can call `.findall()` using Python's `re` library and return our tokens. Notice that our pattern does not match punctuation but properly matches the words and digits.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**Regex ranges and groups**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Let's take a look at another more advanced topic, defining groups and character ranges. Here we have another chart of patterns, and this time we are using ranges or character classes marked by the square brackets and groups marked by the parentheses. We can see in this chart that we can use square brackets to define a new character class. \n",
    "  \n",
    "For example, we can match all upper and lowercase english letters using Uppercase A hyphen Uppercase Z which will match all uppercase and then lowercase a hyphen lowercase z which will match all lowercase letters. \n",
    "  \n",
    "We can also make ranges to match all digits `0-9`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or perhaps a more complex range like uppercase and lowercase English with the hyphen and period. Because the hyphen and period are special characters in regex, we must tell regex we mean an ACTUAL period or hyphen. To do so, we use what is called an escape character and in regex that means to place a backwards slash in front of our character so it knows then to look for a hyphen or period. \n",
    "  \n",
    "On the other hand, with groups which are designated by the parentheses, we can only match what we explicitly define in the group. So a-z matched only a, `a-z`. \n",
    "  \n",
    "Groups are useful when you want to define an explicit group, such as the final example; where we are taking spaces or commas.\n",

If we want to plot a basic histogram, which is a type of plot used to show distribution of data, we can pass in a small array to the `plt.hist()` function. The array `[1, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 9]` has 5 appearing twice and 7 appearing three times, so it's a good candidate to show distribution. Finally, we call the `plt.show()` function and `matplotlib` will show us the generated chart in our system's standard graphics viewing tool.\n",

    "4. `([A-Z]{2,})?`: This part matches an optional sequence of two or more consecutive uppercase letters (A to Z). Similar to the first part, `{2,}` specifies that the pattern (uppercase letters) must occur at least 2 times. The `?` makes this pattern optional.\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. `:`: This part matches the colon character (':').\n",
    "  \n",
    "Putting it all together, the pattern `\"[A-Z]{2,}(\\s)?(#\\d)?([A-Z]{2,})?:\"` can be used to match various patterns in a text. Here are a few examples of strings that would match this pattern:\n",
    "  \n",
    "- \"AB:\"\n",
    "- \"ABC:\"\n",
    "- \"AB #1:\"\n",
    "- \"AB C:\"\n",
    "- \"ABC #1:\"\n",
    "- \"ABC #1 D:\"\n",
    "- INSPECTOR:\n",
    "- OFFICER #1:\n",
    "- OFFICER #2:\n",
    "- CAMERAMAN:\n",
    "- BEDEVERE:\n",
    "- ARTHUR:\n",
    "- FRENCH GUARD:\n",
    "- ROBIN:\n",
    "- BRIDGEKEEPER:\n",
    "- HEAD KNIGHT:\n",
    "  \n",
    "Each part of the pattern serves a specific purpose, allowing for flexibility in matching different variations of uppercase letters, whitespace, a hash symbol followed by a digit, and a colon at the end.\n",
    "  \n",
    "---\n",
    "  \n",
    "In regular expressions (regex), brackets (`[]`), curly brackets (`{}`), and parentheses (`()`) have specific meanings and uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Brackets (`[]`):\n",
    "- Character Class: Inside brackets, you can define a character class to match a single character. For example, `[abc]` matches any character 'a', 'b', or 'c'. It can also define ranges like `[a-z]` to match any lowercase letter.\n",
    "- Negation: Placing a caret (`^`) at the beginning of the brackets negates the character class. For example, `[^0-9]` matches any character that is not a digit.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. Curly Brackets (`{}`):\n",
    "- Quantifiers: Curly brackets are used to specify quantifiers that control the repetition of the preceding element. For example, `a{3}` matches exactly three consecutive 'a' characters, and `a{2,4}` matches 2 to 4 consecutive 'a' characters.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. Parentheses (`()`):\n",
    "- Grouping: Parentheses are used to group parts of a regex pattern together. It allows applying quantifiers, alternations, or other operations to a group as a whole. For example, `(ab)+` matches one or more occurrences of 'ab' in sequence.\n",
    "- Capturing: Parentheses also capture the matched substring for further use. The captured group can be referenced later in the regex or in replacement operations. For example, `(abc)` captures the substring 'abc' for later use.\n",
    "  \n",
    "It's important to note that the usage and behavior of brackets, curly brackets, and parentheses can vary slightly depending on the regex engine or programming language you are using. Therefore, it's recommended to consult the documentation or specific regex resources for the particular regex flavor you are working with."
