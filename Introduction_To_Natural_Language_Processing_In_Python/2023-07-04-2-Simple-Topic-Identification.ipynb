The result is a counter object which has similar structure to a dictionary and allows us to see each token and the frequency of the token. `Counter` objects also have a method called `.most_common()`, which takes an integer argument, such as 2 and would then return the top 2 tokens in terms of frequency. The return object is a series of tuples inside a list. For each tuple, the first element holds the token and the second element represents the frequency. Note: other than ordering by token frequency, the `.most_common()` method does not sort the tokens it returns or tell us there are more tokens with that same frequency.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**Why preprocess?**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Text processing helps make for better input data when performing machine learning or other statistical methods. For example, in the last few exercises you have applied small bits of preprocessing (like tokenization) to create a bag of words. You also noticed that applying simple techniques like lowercasing all of the tokens, can lead to slightly better results for a bag-of-words model. Preprocessing steps like tokenization or lowercasing words are commonly used in NLP. Other common techniques are things like *lemmatization* or *stemming*, where you shorten the words to their root stems, or techniques like removing stop words, which are common words in a language that don't carry a lot of meaning -- such as and or the, or removing punctuation or unwanted tokens. Of course, each model and process will have different results -- so it's good to try a few different approaches to preprocessing and see which works best for your task and goal.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Preprocessing example**\n",
    "  \n",
    "We have here some example input and output text we might expect from preprocessing. First we have a simple two sentence string about pets. Then we have some example output tokens we want. You can see that the text has been tokenized and that everything is lowercase. We also notice that stopwords have been removed and the plural nouns have been made singular.\n",

    "  \n",
    "We can perform text preprocessing using many of the tools we already know and have learned. In this code, we are using the same text as from our previous video, a few sentences about a cat with a box. We can use list comprehensions to tokenize the sentences which we first make lowercase using the string `.lower()` method. The string `.is_alpha()` method will return `True` if the string has only alphabetical characters. We use the `.is_alpha()` method along with an if statement iterating over our tokenized result to only return only alphabetic strings (this will effectively strip tokens with numbers or punctuation). To read out the process in both code and English we say we take each token from the `word_tokenize` output of the lowercase text if it contains only alphabetical characters. In the next line, we use another list comprehension to remove words that are in the stopwords list. This stopwords list for english comes built in with the NLTK library. Finally, we can create a counter and check the two most common words, which are now cat and box (unlike the and box which were the two tokens returned in our first result). Preprocessing has already improved our bag of words and made it more useful by removing the stopwords and non-alphabetic words.\n",

A word embedding or vector is trained from a larger corpus and is a multi-dimensional representation of a word or document. You can think of it as a multi-dimensional array normally with sparse features (lots of zeros and some ones). With these vectors, we can then see relationships among the words or documents based on how near or far they are and also what similar comparisons we find. For example, in this graphic we can see that the vector operation king minus queen is approximately equal to man minus woman. Or that Spain is to Madrid as Italy is to Rome. The deep learning algorithm used to create word vectors has been able to distill this meaning based on how those words are used throughout the text.\n",

A corpus (or if plural, corpora) is a set of texts used to help perform natural language processing tasks. Here, our documents are a list of strings that look like movie reviews about space or sci-fi films. First we need to do some basic preprocessing. For brevity, we will only tokenize and lowercase. For better results, we would want to apply more of the preprocessing we have learned in this chapter, such as removing punctuation and stop words. Then we can pass the tokenized documents to the `Gensim` Dictionary class. This will create a mapping with an id for each token. This is the beginning of our corpus. We now can represent whole documents using just a list of their token ids and how often those tokens appear in each document. We can take a look at the tokens and their ids by looking at the `.token2id` attribute, which is a dictionary of all of our tokens and their respective ids in our new dictionary.\n",

Here, we can see that the `Gensim` corpus is a list of lists, each list item representing one document. Each document a series of tuples, the first item representing the `tokenid` from the dictionary and the second item representing the token frequency in the document. In only a few lines, we have a new bag-of-words model and corpus thanks to `Gensim`. And unlike our previous Counter-based bag of words, this `Gensim` model can be easily saved, updated and reused thanks to the extra tools we have available in `Gensim`. Our dictionary can also be updated with new texts and extract only words that meet particular thresholds.

    "You'll use these data structures to investigate word trends and potential interesting topics in your document set. To get started, we have imported a few additional messy articles from Wikipedia, which were preprocessed by lowercasing all words, tokenizing them, and removing stop words and punctuation. These were then stored in a list of document tokens called `articles`. You'll need to do some light preprocessing and then generate the `gensim` dictionary and corpus.\n",

    "4. Use a list comprehension in which you iterate over articles to create a `gensim` `MmCorpus` from `dictionary`.\n",
    "5. In the output expression, use the `.doc2bow()` method on dictionary with article as the argument.\n",

    "In this video, we will learn how to use a TFIDF model with Gensim.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**What is tf-idf?**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Tf-idf stands for term-frequncy - inverse document frequency. It is a commonly used natural language processing model that helps you determine the most important words in each document in the corpus. The idea behind tf-idf is that each corpus might have more shared words than just stopwords. These common words are like stopwords and should be removed or at least down-weighted in importance. For example, if I am an astronomer, sky might be used often but is not important, so I want to downweight that word. TF-Idf does precisely that. It will take texts that share common language and ensure the most common words across the entire corpus don't show up as keywords. Tf-idf helps keep the document-specific frequent words weighted high and the common words across the entire corpus weighted low.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**Tf-idf formula**\n",
    "  \n",
    "The equation to calculate the weights can be outlined like so: The weight of token $i$ in document $j$ is calculated by taking the term frequency (or how many times the token appears in the document) multiplied by the log of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents that contain the same term. Let's unpack this a bit. First, the weight will be low if the term doesnt appear often in the document because the $tf$ variable will then be low. However, the weight will also be a low if the logarithm ($\\log()$) is close to zero, meaning the internal equation is low. Here we can see if the total number of documents divded by the number of documents that have the term is close to one, then our logarithm will be close to zero. So words that occur across many or all documents will have a very low tf-idf weight. On the contrary, if the word only occurs in a few documents, that logarithm will return a higher number.\n",

    "You can build a Tfidf model using Gensim and the corpus you developed previously. Taking a look at the corpus we used in the last video, around movie reviews, we can use the Bag of Words corpus to translate it into a TF-idf model by simply passing it in initialization. We can then reference each document by using it like a dictionary key with our new tfidf model. For the second document in our corpora, we see the token weights along with the token ids. Notice there are some large differences! Token id 10 has a weight of 0.77 whereas tokens 0 and 1 have weights below 0.18. These weights can help you determine good topics and keywords for a corpus with shared vocabulary.\n",
