    "**What is feature selection?**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Feature selection is a method of selecting features from the feature set to be used for modeling. It draws from a set of existing features, so it's different than feature engineering because it doesn't create new features. The overarching goal of feature selection is to improve the model's performance. Perhaps our existing feature set is much too large, or some of the features we're working with are unnecessary. There are different ways we can perform feature selection. It's possible to do it in an automated way. Scikit-learn has several methods for automated feature selection, such as choosing a variance threshold and using univariate statistical tests, but we won't cover these here. Most of the methods we'll cover in this chapter are more on the manual side, because it's important to truly understand our dataset before using it to train a model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**When to select features**\n",
    "  \n",
    "In this chapter, we'll cover three specific scenarios for feature selection. Sometimes, it helps to git rid of noise in our model. Maybe we have redundant features, like having both latitude and longitude and city and state as geographical features, which can add noise. Or maybe you have features that are strongly statistically correlated, which breaks the assumptions of certain models and impacts model performance. If we're working with text vectors, we'll want to use those tf-idf vectors to determine which set of words to train our model on. And finally, if our feature set is large, it may be beneficial to use dimensionality reduction to combine and reduce the number of features in our dataset in a way that also reduces the overall variance."

    "## Removing redundant features\n",
    "  \n",
    "Feature selection's main goal is to remove unnecessary features from our dataset that might create noise when modeling, so let's talk about redundant features.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Redundant features**\n",
    "  \n",
    "One of the easiest ways to determine if a feature is unnecessary is to check if it is redundant in some way. For example, if it exists in another form as another feature, or if two features are very strongly correlated. Sometimes, when you create features through feature engineering, you end up duplicating existing features in some way. Some redundant features can be identified manually, by simply having an understanding of the features in our dataset. It should be noted that, like the machine learning process in general, feature selection is an iterative process. We might try removing some features only to find it doesn't improve our model's performance, and we might have to reassess our selection choices.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Scenarios for manual removal**\n",
    "  \n",
    "There are a variety of scenarios in which manually removing features makes sense. The first is if our dataset contains repeated information in its feature set. For example, we may see columns related to city, state, latitude and longitude in the same dataset. Perhaps, for our modeling task, using latitude and longitude is specific enough, or perhaps we only need the high-level state information. Or, a dataset might contain if an animal is a dog or a cat and its specific breed. We might want to drop one or the other, depending on the end goal. Another scenario occurs through feature engineering. If we applied feature engineering to extract numbers from a text feature, it's unlikely that we'd need to keep the original text feature. If we took an average to use as an aggregate statistic, it's likely that we could drop the values that generated that aggregate statistic.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Correlated features**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Another clear situation in which we'd want to drop features is when they are highly statistically correlated, meaning they move together directionally. Linear models in particular assume that features are independent of one other, and if features are strongly correlated, that could introduce bias into the model. Let's use Pearson's correlation coefficient to check a feature set for correlation. The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of this directionality: a score closer to 1 between pairs of features means that they move together in the same direction more strongly, a score closer to 0 means features are not correlated, and a score close to -1 means they are strongly negatively correlated, meaning one feature increases in value while the other decreases. We can calculate the Pearson correlation coefficients for each pair of features using pandas.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Here we have a dataset with some numerical values. To check the correlations within a dataset, we call the `.corr()` method on the DataFrame. This returns the correlation scores between each pair of features in the dataset. We can see that features A and B score close to 1, so we should likely drop one of those features."

    "## Selecting features using text vectors\n",
    "  \n",
    "Previously, we used scikit-learn to create a tf-idf vector of text from of a dataset, but we don't necessarily need the entire vector to train a model. We could potentially select something like the top 20% of weighted words across the vector. This is a scenario where iteration is important, and it may be helpful to test out different subsets of the tf-idf vector to see what works. Rather than just blindly taking some top percentage of a tf-idf vector, let's look at how to pull out the words and their weights on a per document basis. It isn't especially straightforward to do this in scikit-learn, but it's very useful. Let's walk through the different parts we'll need to do that.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Looking at word weights**\n",
    "  \n",
    "After we've vectorized our text, the vocabulary and weights will be stored in the vectorizer. To pull out the vocabulary list, which we'll need to look at word weights, we can use the `.vocabulary_` attribute. Here we have a vector of location descriptions from the hiking dataset, and here are the first few words in the vocabulary. Let's also take a look at the row data from the vector itself. Row data contains two components we'll need: the word weights and the index of the word. To take a look at the weight of the fourth row, for example, we use the `.data` attribute on a specific row, accessed with square bracket subsetting. To get the indices of the words that have been weighted, we use the `.indices` attribute.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Looking at word weights**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Before putting together the vocabulary, the word indices, and their weights, we want to reverse the key value pairs in the vocabulary. It'll be easier later on if we have the index number in the key position in the dictionary. To reverse the vocabulary dictionary, we can swap the key-value pairs by grabbing the items from the vocabulary dictionary and reversing the order. If we take a look, we can see that this worked. Finally, we can also zip together the row indices and weights, pass it into the `dict()` function, and turn that into a dictionary.\n",
    "  \n",
    "![Alt text](../_images/word-weight-0.png)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Let's pull this together into a function. We'll pass in the reversed vocab list, the vector, and the row we want to retrieve data for. We'll do row zipping to a dictionary in the function. And finally, we'll return a dictionary mapping the word to its score. So if we pass in the reversed vocabulary list (vocab), the text_tfidf vector, and the index for the 4th row (3), we now have a mapping of scores to words. At this point we could sort by score, or eliminate the words below a certain threshold.\n",

In this first part of text vector exploration, we're going to add to that function we learned about in the slides. We'll return a list of numbers with the function. In the next exercise, we'll write another function to collect the top words across all documents, extract them, and then use that list to filter down our text_tfidf vector.\n",

    "  \n",
    "A less manual way of reducing the size of our feature set is through dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Dimensionality reduction and PCA**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Dimensionality reduction is a form of unsupervised learning that transforms our data in a way that shrinks the number of features in the feature space. This data transformation can be done in a linear or nonlinear fashion. Dimensionality reduction is really a feature extraction method, since that data is being transformed into new and different features. However, since we're treating it here as a reduction in our feature space, we'll cover it in this chapter. The method of dimensionality reduction we'll cover is principal component analysis, or PCA. \n",
    "  \n",
    "PCA uses a linear transformation to project features into a space where they are completely uncorrelated. While the feature space is reduced, the variance is captured in a meaningful way by combining features into components. PCA captures, in each component, as much of the variance in the dataset as possible. In terms of feature selection, it can be a useful method when we have a large number of features and no strong candidates for elimination.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**PCA in scikit-learn**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Transforming a dataset through PCA is relatively straightforward in scikit-learn. Similar to other machine learning methods, scikit-learn requires importing pca and creating the pca object. And just like we did to create tf-idf vectors, we can use PCA's fit_transform method on the dataset we want to reduce dimensionality on. If we print out the new PCA transformed vector, we can see that the data has been transformed. By default, PCA in scikit-learn keeps the number of components equal to the number of input features. If we print out `pca.explained_variance_ratio_`, we can see, by component, the percentage of variance explained by that component. We can see that much of the variance is explained by the first component here, so it's likely that we could drop those components that don't explain much variance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**PCA caveats**\n",
    "  \n",
    "There are a couple of things to note regarding PCA. The first is that it can be very difficult to interpret PCA components beyond which components explain the most variance. PCA is more of a black box method than other methods of dimensionality reduction. The other thing to note is that PCA is a good step to do at the end of the preprocessing journey, because of the way the data gets transformed and reshaped. It can be difficult to do much feature work post-PCA, other than eliminating components that aren't useful for explaining variance."
