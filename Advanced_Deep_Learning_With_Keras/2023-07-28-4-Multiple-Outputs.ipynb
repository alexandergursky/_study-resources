    "In this chapter, I will cover neural networks with 2 outputs. These sorts of networks make predictions for 2 targets at once. For example, you could use a single model to predict the scores of both teams in a basketball game or use a single model to predict both the score difference and the win/loss outcome of that game. To me, this is the most interesting chapter in the class, because it teaches you things that only neural networks can do. At the end of the chapter, I will show you how to make a single model that is both a classifier and a regressor.\n",

    "  \n",
    "To create a model with 2 outputs, we start with an input layer, as with all keras models. In this example, there is only one predictor, so I use an `Input` layer with one input. To make a 2 output model, I simply make a `Dense` layer with 2 units for the output layer. The model will now make 2 predictions! Contrast this model with models from previous chapters, which all had single outputs, and therefore `Dense` output layers with a single unit. The only difference between the 2 output model and the one output model is the size of the output layer.\n",

The model's single input is seed difference, and the 2 outputs are the scores for each team. The fit call is then exactly the same as a single input, single output model. The difference is that the y variable has 2 columns now. This particular model takes a while to converge, so I use 500 epochs in the fit. For the exercises, you will use some additional data in the model that will help it converge faster.\n",

The weights indicate that each additional unit of seed difference for the input data equals about .60 additional points for team 1 (and .60 fewer points for team 2). The bias, or intercept term for each team is about 70 points, indicating that we expect an average basketball team to score about 70 points in an average game. In other words, 2 teams with a 1 point seed difference would be expected to have a score of about 69 to 71, while 2 teams with a 10 point seed difference would be expected to have a score of about 64 to 76.\n",

As before, I define the regression part of this model with a single input and a `Dense` output layer with a single unit. For the classification part of the model, I use the regression model prediction as input and then add another `Dense` output layer on top of it using the `'sigmoid'` activation, which will map the predicted score differences to probabilities that team 1 wins.\n",

    "To fit the combination classification/regression model, you must provide the y data as a list. Recall that this is similar to the way you built two input models in chapter 2. Use `seed_difference` as the only input to this model. For the regression output, I use `score_difference`, and for the classification output, I use whether or not team 1 won the game. I split both of these variables out from the training set and pass them to the fit method as a list. This model fits a bit more quickly than the last one, so I only use 100 `epochs=`.\n",

    "  \n",
    "This model's weight structure is a bit different from the last model, where both outputs were regression targets. The first layer has a weight of 1.24 and a bias of almost zero. This means that a 1 unit change in the teams' seed difference yields about 1.24 additional points in their score difference. So 2 teams with a seed difference of 1 would be expected to have team 1 win by 1.2 points. But 2 teams with a seed difference of 10 would be expected to have team 1 win by 12 points. The next layer maps predicted score difference to predicted win/loss. Recall that the final layer in the model uses `'sigmoid'` activation.\n",

    "You can manually calculate the final layer in the model for some example data, to get an understanding of how the model has learned to relate score difference to win probabilities. `scipy` has a function called `expit()`, which is an efficient implementation of the `'sigmoid'` function. Let's manually calculate the win probability for 2 teams that are predicted to have a score difference of 1. First, multiply 1 by the weight for the final layer in the model: 0.14. Add the bias for the final layer: 0.0007. Since the bias is very close to zero, the result is still 0.14. Finally, we apply the `'sigmoid'` function to 0.14, which yields a prediction of 0.54. In other words, the model has learned that an expected score difference of 1 point is equal to an expected win probability of 54%.\n",

First, split the evaluation dataset into a regression target and a classification target, and provide the same list of 2 targets to the `.evaluate()` method. This outputs 3 numbers now, instead of 1 as with the models we looked at in other chapters. The first number is the loss function used by the model, which is the sum of all the output losses. The second number is the loss for the regression part of the model, and the third number is the loss for the classification part of the model. So our model has a mean absolute error of 9.28 and a logloss of 0.58, which is pretty good, but I think you can do better with more data when you try for yourself. Now you try fitting your own combination regression-classification model!\n",

    "## Wrap-up\n",
    "  \n",
    "In this course, I've tried to focus on designing network topologies that can be used to solve interesting problems.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**So far...**\n",
    "  \n",
    "You learned how to build functional keras models, including advanced topics such as shared layers, categorical embeddings, multiple inputs, and multiple outputs. You can now build a model capable of solving a regression and a classification problem simultaneously.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Shared layers**\n",
    "  \n",
    "In this final video, I'd like to discuss some real-world uses cases of what you've learned. Shared layers are incredibly useful when you want to compare two things. For example, we compared two basketball teams to decide how different they were in their ability to score points in a basketball game, using a shared embedding model. In academic research, shared models are known as \"siamese networks\", which are used to calculate things like document similarity, using shared embedding layer and a shared long-short-term memory layer (or LSTM layer), and then comparing the LSTM outputs. Since both documents are encoded with the same embedding layer and the same LSTM layer, the model learns a representation of the documents that can be used to compare them. \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Multiple inputs**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Multiple input networks are especially useful when you want to process different types of data within your model. For example, in our basketball models, we processed team IDs separately, using an embedding layer. For numeric data such as home vs away, we skipped the embedding step and passed it directly to the output. You can extend this concept to build a network that, for example, uses an LSTM to process text, a standard Dense layer to process numerics, and a convolutional layer (or CNN) to process images. I didn't cover LSTMs or CNNs in this course, but once you understand them, you can use this concept to make networks that understand both text and images!\n",

    "The multiple output network you built in chapter 4 is the coolest model of the course. It can do both classification AND regression! I like this model a lot because the regression problem turns out to be a lot easier than the classification problem. In the regression problem, the neural network gets penalized less for random chance. For example, a team that wins by 1 point got really lucky, and the model can use that information. However, in the classification model, winning by 1 point is the same as winning by 10 points. I think it's pretty cool that we can use the output from the easier regression problem to help solve the more difficult classification problem.\n",

    "**Skip connections**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Here's a final example that we didn't explicitly cover in the class, but that is trivially easy now that you know how to use a concatenate layer. In a paper called \"Visualizing the Loss Landscape of Neural Nets\", Li et al. propose a method called \"skip connections\" to simplify the optimization of neural networks. To summarize a very long and interesting paper, skip connections make it a lot easier for the adam optimizer to find the global minimum of the network's loss function. In Keras, implementing a skip connection is as simple as using the \"Concatenate\" layer to concatenate the inputs to the deep network's outputs, right before the final output layer.\n",
