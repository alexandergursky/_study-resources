    "# Two Input Networks Using Categorical Embeddings, Shared Layers, and Merge Layers\n",

    "In this chapter, you will build two-input networks that use categorical embeddings to represent high-cardinality data, shared layers to specify re-usable building blocks, and merge layers to join multiple inputs to a single output. By the end of this chapter, you will have the foundational building blocks for designing neural networks with complex data flows."

Let's see what we can learn from a much larger sample of data! In the 2 basketball datasets you will be using in this course, there are a little under 11,000 teams. Each team is coded as an integer starting with 1 and ending with 10,887. In this lesson, you will learn how to use those team IDs as inputs to a model that learns the strength of each team.\n",

    "Categorical embeddings are an advanced type of layer, only available in deep learning libraries. They are extremely useful for dealing with high cardinality categorical data. In this dataset, the team ID variable has high cardinality. Embedding layers are also very useful for dealing with text data, such as in Word2vec models, but that is beyond the scope of this course. To model these teams in the basketball data, you'll use a very simple model that learns a \"strength\" rating for each team and uses those ratings to make predictions. To map the integer team IDs to a decimal rating, we will use an embedding layer.\n",

Note that this dataset covers about 30 years of data, and has about 400 unique schools, giving us close to 12,000 IDs.

Since you have 10,887 unique teams in the dataset, you define the input dimension of the embedding layer as 10,887. As you are representing each team as a single integer, use an input length of 1. You want to produce a single team strength rating, so use an output dimension of 1. Finally, name your layer, so you can easily find it when looking at the `model.summary()`, or plot. To use the embedding layer, connect it to the tensor produced by the input layer. This will produce an embedding output tensor.\n",

We then define 2 input tensors, and pass each one to the same model, producing 2 output tensors.
