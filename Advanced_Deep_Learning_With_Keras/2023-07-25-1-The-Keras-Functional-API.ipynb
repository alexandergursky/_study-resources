    "# The Keras Functional API\n",
    "  \n",
    "This course shows you how to solve a variety of problems using the versatile Keras functional API. You will start with simple, multi-layer dense networks (also known as multi-layer perceptrons), and continue on to more complicated architectures. The course will cover how to build models with multiple inputs and a single output, as well as how to share weights between layers in a model. We will also cover advanced topics such as category embeddings and multiple-output networks. If you've ever wanted to train a network that does both classification and regression, then this course is for you!\n",

    "Your goal is to predict which team will win a tournament game. The only data you have to work with are the team's \"seeds\", which are assigned by the tournament organizers, and are a rating of how good the team is. A seed of 1 is a very good team, and a seed of 16 is a very bad team. In the 30 plus year history of the tournament, a 16 seed has beat a 1 seed exactly once. It was in 2018, which was a very exciting year for college basketball fans.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Your input will be the difference in seed between the two teams. For example, if a 7 seed plays a 10 seed, their seed difference is 7 minus 10, or -3. If an 11 seed plays a 7 seed, their seed difference is 11 minus 7, or 4.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Your output will be the difference in score between the two teams. For example, if team 1 scores 41 points and team 2 scores 50 points, the score difference is 41 minus 50, or negative 9. On the other hand, if team 1 scores 61 points and team 2 scores 55 points, the score difference is 61 minus 55 or positive 6.\n",

Note that you have both a 16 seed playing a 1 seed, and a 1 seed playing a 16 seed in your data, so you'll have seed differences ranging from negative 15 to positive 15.\n",

    "A seed difference of positive 15 means that team 1 has a seed of 16 and is playing a team of seed of 1. This means team 1 is likely (though not certain) to lose. A seed difference of negative 15 means that team 1 has a seed of 1 and is playing a team of seed of 16. This means team 1 is likely (though not certain) to win.

Use the seed_diff column from the dataset as the input and the score_diff column from the dataset as the output. The fit method has some additional arguments, which can be useful: Batch size sets how many rows of data are used for each step of stochastic gradient descent. In this case, you'll train on 64 rows at a time. Validation split tells Keras to use a holdout set, and return metrics on accuracy using that data. This can be useful for validating that your models will perform well on new data. When verbose is set to True, Keras prints a log during training. This can be useful for debugging, but usually, I set it to False once I like how the model works.\n",

To do this, you can use the evaluate() method of the model, and pass it the X variables and Y variables from the new data. When you do this, Keras will report error metrics on the new data.\n",
