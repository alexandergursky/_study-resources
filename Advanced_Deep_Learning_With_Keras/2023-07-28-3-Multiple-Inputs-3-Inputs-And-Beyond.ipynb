    "**Simple model with 3 inputs**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Making a keras model with 3 inputs is almost exactly the same as making a Keras model with two inputs. To start, create three different input layers. In this case, you'll use a Concatenate layer to combine the inputs, but recall from the previous chapters that you could also use an `Add` or `Subtract` layer. In the `Concatenate` layer, simply pass a list of three inputs, rather than two. Finally, add a Dense layer to reduce the three inputs to a single output.\n",

    "In the exercises for this chapter, you will also practice using a shared layer in a model with more than two inputs. For example, you can pass the first two inputs to a shared layer and then concatenate the result of that shared layer with the third input. In other words, you can define a Keras model in any way you want! This gives you a lot of flexibility to customize the model to the problem you want to solve.\n",

    "**Fitting a 3 input model**\n",
    "  \n",
    "As with any Keras model, you must compile it before fitting. During compilation, you specify a loss function and an optimizer. When fitting a three input model, provide a list with three input columns, rather than two. Since this model only has one output, use a single output in your model. Similarly, when evaluating your model on new data, using `model.evaluate()`, pass three inputs in a list and one output. It's time for you to fit three-input models. Once you understand how easy it is to extend two input models to three inputs, you should also be able to make models with four inputs, or five, or more!"

    "  \n",
    "The summary shows you all the layers in the model, as well as how many parameters each layer has. Importantly, Keras models can have non-trainable parameters that are fixed and do not change, as well as trainable parameters, that are learned from the data when the model is fit. Models with more trainable parameters are typically more flexible. This can also make them more prone to overfitting. Models with fewer trainable parameters are less flexible, but therefore less likely to overfit. In this case, the model has three inputs. Since all three of them feed into one Dense layer, the model has four parameters: one per input plus a bias, or intercept. All of these parameters are trainable. A model's trainable parameters are usually in its Dense layers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The summary of a slightly more complicated model. You can see that this model has an embedding layer. Even though the dense layer still only has 4 parameters, the model has many more trainable parameters, because of the embedding layer. It's important to remember that embedding layers often add a very large number of trainable parameters to a model. Recall that embedding layers map integers to floats: each unique value of the embedding input gets a parameter for its output.\n",

    "A very complicated model. The box at the bottom of the image represents the model's output. In this case, the model has one output. Note that output layers have arrows coming in, but no arrows going out. The boxes in the middle of the image represent intermediate steps in the model. These boxes have arrows coming in, and arrows going out. Note that this model has a shared model: the team strength model, which is applied to two of the inputs before they are combined in the concatenate layer with the third input. The boxes at the top of the image represent the inputs. These boxes only have one arrow going out and none coming in.\n",

    "Here's another way of looking at the same model, using the network diagrams I've made for the previous chapter's models. Shared models work exactly the same as shared layers. This is a useful abstraction because you can put together a sequence of layers to define a custom model, and then share the entire model in exactly the same way you'd share a layer. It's a little prettier when you make them by hand, but the auto-plotting function in Keras does a good job representing the actual structure of the model. Now that I've shown you how to summarize and plot models, you try it for yourself!\n",

    "## Stacking models\n",
    "  \n",
    "In this video, I will introduce you to the concept of \"model stacking\" or using the predictions from one model as an input to another model. Model stacking is a very advanced data science concept. It is the most sophisticated way of combining models, and when done right can yield some of the most accurate models in existence. Model stacking is often employed to win popular predictive modeling competitions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Stacking models requires 2 datasets**\n",
    "  \n",
    "In this course, you have been working with two datasets: the college basketball data from the regular season and the college basketball data from the post-season tournament. Both datasets contain the two teams playing, whether team 1 is home or away, and the score difference of the games. The tournament dataset additionally contains the difference in seeds of the two teams playing.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<center><img src='../_images/stacking-models-neural-networks.png' alt='img' width='500'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Enrich the tournament data**\n",
    "  \n",
    "There's a lot more data on regular season games than there is on tournament games. The regular season dataset has over 300,000 rows, but the tournament dataset only has about 4,000 rows. 4,000 rows of data is pretty small. Recall that our embedding layer has about 11,000 inputs. 4,000 rows of data is not enough to learn all 11,000 parameters in our embedding layer. In the previous lesson, you built a three-input model on the regular season data. You can re-use this model to add predictions from the regular season model to the tournament dataset.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<center><img src='../_images/stacking-models-neural-networks1.png' alt='img' width='500'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Enrich the tournament data**\n",
    "  \n",
    "This diagram shows the process for stacking these 2 models. You start with the regular season dataset and fit a model to it. You then predict on the tournament dataset, using this model. This gives you predicted tournament outcomes, which you can now use to build a better model of the actual tournament outcomes. You additionally use the tournament seeds when modeling the tournament. These tournament seeds come from a committee, and are intended to, like your model, capture each team's \"strength,\" without using an embedding layer. The tournament seeds can be thought of as a simplified version of your team strength model, determined by a human rather than a computer.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<center><img src='../_images/stacking-models-neural-networks2.png' alt='img' width='500'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**3 input model with pure numeric data**\n",
    "  \n",
    "The prediction from the regular season model captures the effects of team_1 and team_2, which means you now don't need to use those two variables in the tournament model, and can avoid the use of an embedding layer. You can focus your modeling efforts on the purely numeric data, which is a little easier to work with. With purely numeric inputs, you can pass all of them to a single input layer.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<center><img src='../_images/stacking-models-neural-networks3.png' alt='img' width='500'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "In other words, an input layer with a shape of 3 is another way of defining a 3 input model. The only drawback of this approach is that all the inputs must be numeric.\n",
    "  \n",
    "A huge advantage of this approach is simplicity. You can create a model with a single input tensor and an output tensor, and fit it using a single dataset. Similarly, evaluating the model requires a single dataset, rather than a list. As you can see, this stacked model is pretty accurate! It's off, on average, by about 9 points in a given game.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<center><img src='../_images/stacking-models-neural-networks4.png' alt='img' width='500'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Let's practice!**\n",
    "  \n",
    "To recap: stacking keras models means using the predictions from one model as an input to a second model. When stacking, it's important to use different datasets for each model. In this case, you use the regular season data for one model and the tournament dataset for the second model. Finally, if your input dataset is purely numeric, you can put multiple inputs in a single input layer. Lets practice using these concepts!"
