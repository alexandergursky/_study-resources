    "## Pipeline\n",
    "  \n",
    "Welcome back! So far you've learned how to build classifier and regression models using Spark. In this chapter you'll learn how to make those models better. You'll start by taking a look at pipelines, which will seriously streamline your workflow. They will also help to ensure that training and testing data are treated consistently and that no leakage of information between these two sets takes place.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Leakage?**\n",
    "  \n",
    "What do I mean by leakage? Most of the actions you've been using involve both a `.fit()` and a `.transform()` method. Those methods have been applied in a fairly relaxed way. But to get really robust results you need to be careful only to apply the `.fit()` method to training data. Why? Because if a `.fit()` method is applied to *any* of the testing data then the model will effectively have seen those data during the training phase, so the results of testing will no longer be objective. The `.transform()` method, on the other hand, can be applied to both training and testing data since it does not result in any changes in the underlying model.\n",

    "<center><img src='../_images/pipeline-leakage-in-pyspark.png' alt='img' width='740'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**A leaky model**\n",
    "  \n",
    "A figure should make this clearer. Leakage occurs whenever a `.fit()` method is applied to testing data. Suppose that you fit a model using both the training and testing data. The model would then already have *seen* the testing data, so using those data to test the model would not be fair: of course the model will perform well on data which has been used for training! This sounds obvious, but care must be taken not to fall into this trap. Remember that there are normally multiple stages in building a model and if the `.fit()` method in *any* of those stages is applied to the testing data then the model is compromised.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**A watertight model**\n",
    "  \n",
    "However, if you are careful to only apply `.fit()` to the training data then your model will be in good shape. When it comes to testing it will not have seen *any* of the testing data and the test results will be completely objective. Luckily a pipeline will make it easier to avoid leakage because it simplifies the training and testing process.\n",

    "**Pipeline**\n",

    "A pipeline is a mechanism to combine a series of steps. Rather than applying each of the steps individually, they are all grouped together and applied as a single unit.\n",

    "**Cars model: Steps**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Let's return to our cars regression model. Recall that there were a number of steps involved: - using a string indexer to convert the type column to indexed values;  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- applying a one-hot encoder to convert those indexed values into dummy variables; then \n",
    "- assembling a set of predictors into a single features column; and finally \n",

    "  \n",
    "**Cars model: Applying steps**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Let's map out the process of applying those steps. - First you fit the indexer to the training data. Then you call the `.transform()` method on the training data to add the indexed column. - Then you call the `.transform()` method on the testing data to add the indexed column there too. Note that the testing data was not used to fit the indexer. Next you do the same things for the one-hot encoder, fitting to the training data and then using the fitted encoder to update the training and testing data sets. The assembler is next. In this case there is no `.fit()` method, so you simply apply the `.transform()` method to the training and testing data. Finally the data are ready. You fit the regression model to the training data and then use the model to make predictions on the testing data. Throughout the process you've been careful to keep the testing data out of the training process. But this is hard work and it's easy enough to slip up.\n",

You create a pipeline by specifying a sequence of `'stages='`, where each stage corresponds to a step in the model building process. The `'stages='` are executed in order. Now, rather than calling the `.fit()` and `.transform()` methods for each stage, you simply call the `.fit()` method for the pipeline on the training data. Each of the `'stages='` in the pipeline is then automatically applied to the training data in turn. This will systematically apply the `.fit()` and `.transform()` methods for each stage in the pipeline. The trained pipeline can then be used to make predictions on the testing data by calling its `.transform()` method. The pipeline `.transform()` method will only call the `.transform()` method for each of the `'stages='` in the pipeline. Isn't that simple?\n",

There's one major drawback to this approach: you only get one estimate of the model performance. You would have a more robust idea of how well a model works if you were able to test it multiple times. This is precisely the idea behind cross-validation.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**CV - multiple folds**\n",
    "  \n",
    "You then split the training data into a number of partitions or \"folds\". The number of folds normally factors into the name of the technique. For example, if you split into five folds then you'd talk about 5-fold cross-validation.\n",

    "  \n",
    "Once the training data have been split into folds you can start cross-validating. First keep aside the data in the first fold. Train a model on the remaining four folds. Then evaluate that model on the data from the first fold. This will give the first value for the evaluation metric.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Fold upon fold - second fold**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Next you move onto the second fold, where the same process is repeated: data in the second fold are set aside for testing while the remaining four folds are used to train a model. That model is tested on the second fold data, yielding the second value for the evaluation metric.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Fold upon fold - other folds**\n",
    "  \n",
    "You repeat the process for the remaining folds. Each of the folds is used in turn as testing data and you end up with as many values for the evaluation metric as there are folds. At this point you are in a position to calculate the average of the evaluation metric over all folds, which is a much more robust measure of model performance than a single value.\n",

    "The second ensemble model you'll be looking at is Gradient-Boosted Trees. Again the aim is to build a collection of diverse models, but the approach is slightly different. Rather than building a set of trees that operate in parallel, now we build trees which work in series. The boosting algorithm works iteratively. First build a decision tree and add to the ensemble. Then use the ensemble to make predictions on the training data. Compare the predicted labels to the known labels. Now identify training instances where predictions were incorrect. Return to the start and train another tree which focuses on improving the incorrect predictions. As trees are added to the ensemble its predictions improve because each new tree focuses on correcting the shortcomings of the preceding trees.\n",

    "Congratulations on completing this course on Machine Learning with Apache Spark. You have covered a lot of ground, reviewing some Machine Learning fundamentals and seeing how they can be applied to large datasets, using Spark for distributed computing.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Things you've learned**\n",
    "  \n",
    "You learned how to load data into Spark and then perform a variety of operations on those data. Specifically, you learned basic column manipulation on DataFrames, how to deal with text data, bucketing continuous data and one-hot encoding categorical data. You then delved into two types of classifiers, Decision Trees and Logistic Regression, in the process building a robust spam classifier. You also learned about partitioning your data and how to use testing data and a selection of metrics to evaluate a model. Next you learned about regression, starting with a simple linear regression model and progressing to penalized regression, which allowed you to build a model using only the most relevant predictors. You learned about pipelines and how they can make your Spark code cleaner and easier to maintain. This led naturally into using cross-validation and grid search to derive more robust model metrics and use them to select good model parameters. Finally you encountered two forms of ensemble models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning more**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Of course, there are many topics that were not covered in this course. If you want to dig deeper then consult the excellent and extensive online documentation. Importantly you can find instructions for setting up and securing a Spark cluster.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Congratulations!**\n",

    "Now go and use what you've learned to solve challenging and interesting big data problems in the real world!"
