    "## Configuring Git\n",
    "  \n",
    "Let's look at some tips and tricks to improve our workflow by configuring settings.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Why do we need to configure our settings?**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Git has a range of customizable settings that can simplify our version control tasks, resulting in improved productivity!\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Levels of settings**\n",
    "  \n",
    "To access a list of customizable settings, we can run `git config --list`. Git has three levels of settings. We can add `--local` to the command to see settings for one specific project. `--global` shows settings for all of our projects, and `--system` displays settings for every user on this computer.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<center><img src='../_images/configuring-git.png' alt='img' width='740'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "Each level overrides the one above it, so local settings take precedence over global settings, taking precedence over system settings.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<center><img src='../_images/configuring-git1.png' alt='img' width='740'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**What can we configure?**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Here, we run `git config --list` to view the list of all customizable settings. Of those displayed, the most commonly customized are user.email and user.name, as some commands will require our credentials, so including them in our Git configuration will save time. Note that these are both global settings.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<center><img src='../_images/configuring-git2.png' alt='img' width='740'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Changing our settings**\n",
    "  \n",
    "We can modify a global setting using the syntax `git config --global setting value`. For example, to change our email address to johnsmith-at-datacamp.com, we execute `git config --global user.email johnsmith-at-datacamp.com`. Likewise, we can change our username to John Smith by executing `git config --global user.name John Smith`. Note that we place the name in single quotations. If we don't do this and our user name has a space, Git will ignore anything after the space. So, this command would save the user name as John.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<center><img src='../_images/configuring-git3.png' alt='img' width='740'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Using an alias**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Another cool way to speed up our workflow is to use an alias for common commands. We can set up an alias through global settings. A typical use case is to shorten the length of a command. Suppose we want to create an alias for committing files with a log message using the alias \"ci\" instead of commit. We execute `git config --global alias.ci commit -m`. As with updating our user name, we use single quotations around `commit -m` because this command has a space. Now we can commit files with a log message by executing `git ci` instead of `git commit -m`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<center><img src='../_images/configuring-git4.png' alt='img' width='740'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Creating a custom alias**\n",
    "  \n",
    "We can create a custom alias for any command that we perform regularly. If we often unstage files, we can create an alias. We execute the same command as before, creating an alias called unstage and assigning it to the `reset HEAD` command. A word of warning - while aliasing is a valuable tool for working more efficiently with Git, we need to ensure the aliases we create don't overwrite any existing Git or shell commands!\n",
    "  \n",
    "<center><img src='../_images/configuring-git5.png' alt='img' width='740'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Tracking aliases**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Git helps us track our aliases by storing them in a .git config file. We can access it by calling `git config --global --list`. The output will be a list showing the alias and the original command it is assigned to. Here, we see ci and unstage.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<center><img src='../_images/configuring-git6.png' alt='img' width='740'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Ignoring specific files**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Another helpful trick is to instruct Git to ignore certain files. We do this by creating a file called .gitignore.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<center><img src='../_images/configuring-git7.png' alt='img' width='740'></center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Ignoring specific files**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Here we add *.log inside the .gitignore file using `nano`. The asterisk is a wildcard, which means Git will ignore any files ending with .log. Other files commonly ignored include API keys or credentials, system files, or software dependencies.\n",
    "  \n",
