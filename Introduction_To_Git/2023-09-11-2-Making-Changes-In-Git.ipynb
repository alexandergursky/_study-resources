The second part is a tree, which tracks the names and locations in the repo when that commit happened. For each file listed in the tree, there is a blob, which is short for binary large object. A blob may contain data of any kind. Blobs contain a compressed snapshot of the contents of the file when the commit happened.\n",

In this instance, git will undo changes to all unstaged files in the current directory and any sub-directories.
