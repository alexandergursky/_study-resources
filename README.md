# Study Resources
  
Reference blog for notebooks, various studies, book exercises, tutorials, and other platforms.
  
TODO:
- Add topic index here on README:
- - ie. Machine Learning, NLP, Algorithms, TF-IDF, Computer Vision, Data-processing, Python, Julia, etc.
- Add dataset index for types of problems.
- Add application index for code snippets.
- Fix notebook formatting on older notebooks, maybe even re-do the exercises.
- Cycle through notebooks and make sure links/embeddings work.
- Create HTML files for the notebooks.
