    "# R-squared:                    is the absolute amount of variation as a proportion of total variation. quantifies the amount of variance in the target variable that is explained by the features. Ranges from 0 to 1, 0=low, 1=high\n",
    "# Mean Squared Error (MSE):     measures the amount of error in statistical models. It assesses the average squared difference between the observed and predicted values. When a model has no error, the MSE equals zero. As model error increases, its value increases.\n",
    "# Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE):Root mean square error or root mean square deviation is one of the most commonly used measures for evaluating the quality of predictions. It shows how far predictions fall from measured true values using Euclidean distance.\n",

    "#                               Another benefit of satisfying these assumptions is that as the sample size increases to infinity, the coefficient estimates converge on the actual population parameters.\n",

    "#                               The regression results are sensitive to functional form if the error term is not adequately interpreted, which can lead to widely varying conclusions depending on how the regression is initially set up.\n",

    "#                               Cross-validation is a vital approach to evaluating a model. It maximizes the amount of data that is available to the model, as the model is not only trained but also tested on all of the available data.\n",
