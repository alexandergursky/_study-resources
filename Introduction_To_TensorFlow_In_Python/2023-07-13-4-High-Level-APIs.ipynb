Once we have defined this object, we can simply stack layers on top of it sequentially using the add method. Let's start by adding the first hidden layer, which is a dense layer with 16 nodes. We'll select a relu activation function and supply an `input_shape=`, which Keras requires for the first layer. This input shape is simply a tuple that contains the dimensions of our data. Since we'll be using 28 by 28 pixel images, reshaped into vector, we'll supply 28*28 comma as the input shape.\n",

If we want to check our model's architecture, we can use the `.summary()` method, which we'll return to in the upcoming exercises. The model has now been defined, but it is not yet ready to be trained. We must first perform a compilation step, where we specify the optimizer and loss function. Here, we've selected the adam optimizer and the categorical crossentropy loss function, which we'll use for classification problems with more than 2 classes.\n",

The number of times you train on the full set of batches is called the number of epochs. Here, the `batch_size=` is 5 and the number of `epochs=` is 2. Using multiple epochs allows the model to revisit the same batches, but with different model weights and possibly `optimizer=` parameters, since they are updated after each batch.\n",

You can use the `.evaluate()` operation to check performance on the test set at the end of the training process. Since you may tune model parameters in response to validation set performance, using a separate test set will provide you with further assurance that you have not overfitted.

    "  \n",
    "The Estimators API is a high level TensorFlow submodule. Relative to the core, lower-level TensorFlow APIs and the high-level Keras API, model building in the Estimator API is less flexible. This is because it enforces a set of best practices by placing restrictions on model architecture and training. The upside of using the Estimators API is that it allows for faster deployment. Models can be specified, trained, evaluated, and deployed with less code. Furthermore, there are many premade models that can be instantiated by setting a handful of model parameters.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**Model specification and training**\n",
    "  \n",
    "So what does the typical model specification and training process look like in the Estimators API? Well, it starts with the definition of feature columns, which specify the shape and type of your data. Next, you load and transform your data within a function. The output of this function will be a dictionary object of features and your labels. The next step is to define an estimator. In this video, we'll use premade estimators, but you can also define custom estimators with different architectures. Finally, you will train the model you defined. Note that all model objects created through the Estimators API have train, evaluate, and predict operations.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**Defining feature columns**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Let's step through this procedure to get a sense of how it works. We'll first define the feature columns. If we were working with the housing dataset from chapter 2, we might define a numeric feature column for size using `feature_column.numeric_column`. Note that we supplied the dictionary key, \"size,\" to the operation. We will do this for each feature column we create. We may also want a categorical feature column for the number of rooms using `feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list`.\n",

    "  \n",

    "  \n",
    "We next need to define a function that transforms our data, puts the features in a dictionary, and returns both the features and labels. Note that we've simply taken three examples from the housing dataset for the sake of illustration. Using them, we've defined a dictionary with the keys \"size\" and \"rooms,\" which maps to the feature columns we defined. Next, we define a list or array of labels, which give the price of the house in this case, and then return the features and labels.\n",

If we're predicting house prices, we may want to use a deep neural network with a regression head using `estimator.DNNRegressor`. This allows us to predict a continuous target. Note that all we had to supply was the list of feature columns and the number of nodes in each hidden layer. The rest is handled automatically. We then apply the train function, supply our input function, and train for 20 `steps=`.\n",

    "For this exercise, we'll return to the King County housing transaction dataset from chapter 2. We will again develop and train a machine learning model to predict house prices; however, this time, we'll do it using the `estimator` API.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Rather than completing everything in one step, we'll break this procedure down into parts. We'll begin by defining the feature columns and loading the data. In the next exercise, we'll define and train a premade `estimator`. Note that `feature_column` has been imported for you from `tensorflow`. Additionally, `numpy` has been imported as `np`, and the Kings County `housing` dataset is available as a `pandas` DataFrame: `housing`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "1. Complete the feature column for bedrooms and add another numeric feature column for bathrooms. Use `bedrooms` and `bathrooms` as the keys.\n",
    "2. Create a list of the feature columns, `feature_list`, in the order in which they were defined.\n",
    "3. Set `labels` to be equal to the price column in `housing`.\n",
    "4. Complete the `bedrooms` entry of the `features` dictionary and add another entry for `bathrooms`.\n"

    "## Chapter Complete\n",
    "  \n",
    "You've now completed this course on the fundamentals of the TensorFlow API in Python. In this final video, we'll review what you've learned, talk about two useful TensorFlow extensions, and then wrap-up with a discussion of the transition to TensorFlow 2.0.\n",
    "  \n",
    "What you learned\n",
    "  \n",
    "In chapter 1, you learned low-level, basic, and advanced operations in TensorFlow. You learned how to define and manipulate variables and constants. You also learned the graph-based computational model that underlies TensorFlow and how it can be used to compute gradients and solve arbitrary optimization problems. In chapter 2, you learned how to load and transform data for use in your TensorFlow projects. You also saw how to use predefined and custom loss functions. We ended with a discussion of how to train models, and when and how to divide the training into batches.\n",
    "  \n",
    "What you learned\n",
    "  \n",
    "In chapter 3, we moved on to training neural networks. You learned how to define neural network architecture in TensorFlow, both using low-level linear algebra operations and high-level Keras API operations. We talked about how to select activation functions and optimizers, and, ultimately, how to train models. In chapter 4, you learned how to make full use of the Keras API to train models in TensorFlow. We discussed the training and validation process and also introduced the high-level Estimators API, which can be used to streamline the production process.\n",
    "  \n",
    "TensorFlow extensions\n",
    "  \n",
    "In addition to what we covered, there are also a two important TensorFlow extensions that did not fit into the course, but may be worthwhile to explore on your own. The first is TensorFlow Hub, which allows users to import pretrained models that can then be used to perform transfer learning. This will be particularly useful when you want to train an image classifier with a small number of images, but want to make use of a feature-extractor trained on a much larger set of different images. TensorFlow Probability is another exciting extension, which is also currently available as a standalone module. One benefit of using TensorFlow Probability is that it provides additional statistical distributions that can be used for random number generation. It also enables you to incorporate trainable statistical distributions into your models. Finally, TensorFlow Probability provides an extended set of optimizers that are commonly used in statistical research. This gives you additional tools beyond what the core TensorFlow module provides.\n",
    "  \n",
    "TensorFlow 2.0\n",
    "  \n",
    "Finally, I will say a few words about the difference between TensorFlow 2 and TensorFlow 1. If you primarily develop in 1, you may have noticed that you do not need to define static graphs or enable eager execution. This is done automatically in 2. Furthermore, TensorFlow 2 has substantially tighter integration with Keras. In fact, the core functionality of the TensorFlow 1 train module is handled by `tf.keras` operations in 2. In addition to the centrality of Keras, the Estimators API also plays a more important role in TensorFlow 2. Finally, TensorFlow 2 also allows you to use static graphs, but they are available through the `tf.function` operation.\n",
