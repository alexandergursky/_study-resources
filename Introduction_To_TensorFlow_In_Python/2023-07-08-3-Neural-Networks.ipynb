    "The previous chapters taught you how to build models in TensorFlow 2. In this chapter, you will apply those same tools to build, train, and make predictions with neural networks. You will learn how to define dense layers, apply activation functions, select an optimizer, and apply regularization to reduce overfitting. You will take advantage of TensorFlow's flexibility by using both low-level linear algebra and high-level Keras API operations to define and train models."

Here, we have the familiar linear regression model. We take marital status, which is 1, and bill amount, which is 3. We then multiply the inputs by their respective weights, 0.10 and -0.25, and sum.\n",

Each hidden layer node takes our two inputs, multiplies them by their respective weights, and sums them together. We also typically pass the hidden layer output to an activation function, but we will come back to that later. Finally, we sum together the outputs of the two hidden layers to compute our prediction for default. This entire process of generating a prediction is referred to as *forward propagation*.\n",

The output layer contains our prediction. Each hidden layer takes inputs from the previous layer, applies numerical weights to them, sums them together, and then applies an activation function. In the neural network graph, we have applied a particular type of hidden layer called a dense layer. \n",

We then initialize weights as a variable, since we will train those weights to predict the output from the inputs. We also define a bias, which will play a similar role to the intercept in the linear regression model.\n",

    "Finally, we define a dense layer. Note that we first perform a matrix multiplication of the inputs by the weights and assign that to the tensor named product. We then add product to the bias and apply a non-linear transformation, in this case the sigmoid function. This is called the activation function and we will explore this in more depth in the next video, but do not worry about it for now. Furthermore, note that the bias is not associated with a feature and is analogous to the intercept in a linear regression. We will typically not draw it in neural network diagrams for simplicity.\n",

In this example, we take input data and convert it to a 32-bit float tensor. We then define a first hidden dense layer using `keras.layers.Dense`. The first argument specifies the number of outgoing nodes. And the second argument is the activation function. By default, a bias will be included. Note that we've also passed inputs as an argument to the first dense layer.\n",

The high-level approach relies on complex operations in high-level APIs, such as Keras and Estimators, reducing the amount of code needed. The weights and the mathematical operations will typically be hidden by the layer constructor. The low-level approach uses linear algebra, which allows for the construction of any model. TensorFlow allows us to use either approach or even combine them. You now know how to construct dense layers using both the high and low-level approaches.\n",

    "So what is a minimization problem? And what can go wrong when we try to solve one? Let's start with a simple thought experiment: you want to find the lowest point in the Grand Canyon, but all you can do is pick a point, measure the elevation, and then repeat the same to nearby points. This is what you do when you train a neural network: you pick a starting point, measure the loss, and then try to move to a lower loss. We will see how a common optimization algorithm, gradient descent, solves this problem.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Let's start by picking a point and measuring the elevation. From that point, we'll move along the slope until we arrive on a flat surface. To understand what's going on, imagine you dropped a ball into the canyon from the point you selected. If you drop the ball on a slope above a plateau, the ball will stop when it reaches the plateau. If this happens, the gradient descent algorithm will fail. It will stop on a local minimum and will progress no further.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Let's say you pick a different spot. This time, the ball lands on a slope with an unobstructed path to the lowest point in the canyon. Here, the gradient descent algorithm works and ball reaches the global minimum. Notice that gravity performs the role of the gradient descent optimizer.\n",

Think of a higher `learning_rate=` as exerting more force on the ball than gravity alone. The ball will move faster and skip over some plateaus, but it may miss the global minimum, too.

    "`tf.keras.metrics.binary_crossentropy()` is a loss function commonly used in binary classification tasks. It measures the dissimilarity or error between predicted probabilities and `True` binary labels.\n",
    "  \n",
    "To put it simply, `binary_crossentropy()` quantifies how well a model's predicted probabilities match the true labels in a binary classification problem. It calculates the average \"distance\" or discrepancy between the predicted probabilities and the actual labels.\n",
    "  \n",
    "In other words, `binary_crossentropy()` helps determine how accurate the predicted probabilities are in representing the `True` binary labels. The lower the binary cross-entropy value, the better the model's predictions align with the `True` labels. The loss value is minimized during the training process to improve the model's performance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<span style='color:#7393B3'>NOTE:</span> When to use  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Binary cross-entropy is typically used when there are only two possible classes or labels, such as classifying an email as spam or not spam. If you have multiple classes, you would use `categorical_crossentropy()` instead.\n",

    "<span style='color:#7393B3'>NOTE:</span> Operations preformed  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Binary cross-entropy is calculated by comparing the predicted probabilities generated by a model with the true binary labels. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:\n",
    "  \n",
    "1. For each instance or sample in the dataset, the model produces a predicted probability between 0 and 1. This probability represents the model's confidence that the instance belongs to the positive class (e.g., class 1 or \"True\") in a binary classification problem.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. The true binary label for each instance is either 0 or 1, indicating the actual class membership.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. Binary cross-entropy measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probabilities and the true labels. It penalizes large errors and rewards accurate predictions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. To calculate the binary cross-entropy, the predicted probabilities and true labels are compared using the following formula:\n",
    "  \n",
    "   - For a positive class instance (true label = 1): \n",
    "     - If the predicted probability is close to 1, the loss is low.\n",
    "     - If the predicted probability is close to 0, the loss is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For a negative class instance (true label = 0): \n",
    "     - If the predicted probability is close to 0, the loss is low.\n",
    "     - If the predicted probability is close to 1, the loss is high.\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. The binary cross-entropy loss is calculated for each instance, and then the average loss is taken across all instances in the dataset.\n",
    "  \n",
    "6. During the training process, the goal is to minimize the binary cross-entropy loss by adjusting the model's parameters (weights and biases) through techniques like gradient descent.

You will now train the model and then evaluate its performance by predicting default outcomes in a test set, which consists of `test_features` and `test_targets` and is available to you. The trainable variables are `w1`, `b1`, `w2`, and `b2`.
